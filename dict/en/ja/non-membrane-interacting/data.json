It describes something that does not bind to or interact with a cell membrane. If a protein is described as 'non-membrane-interacting', it means that it functions or resides in the cell without needing to attach to or pass through a cell membrane. This is important for understanding how different molecules function within a cell.","priority":"medium"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The study focused on identifying non-membrane-interacting proteins involved in DNA replication.","translation":"その研究は、DNA複製に関与する膜と相互作用しないタンパク質の特定に焦点を当てた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"膜と相互作用しない"},{"sentence":"Unlike other receptors, this one exhibits a non-membrane-interacting signaling pathway.","translation":"他の受容体とは異なり、これは膜との相互作用を必要としないシグナル伝達経路を示す。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"膜との相互作用を必要としない"}]}

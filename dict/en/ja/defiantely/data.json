'Defy' originates from the Old French word 'desfier,' meaning 'to renounce faith in, challenge, provoke,' which in turn comes from Vulgar Latin '*disfidare,' meaning 'to break faith.' This is composed of 'dis-' (expressing reversal) and 'fidare' (to trust), from 'fides' (faith).","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/dɪˈfaɪəntli/","syllables":"de-fi-ant-ly"},"inflection":{"notes":"As an adverb, 'defiantly' does not have different inflections."},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Defiantly' describes actions or behaviors that openly show resistance to authority or opposition.

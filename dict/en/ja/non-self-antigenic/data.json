It describes anything that comes from outside the body and can cause the body's immune system to react. Think of it as the opposite of something that's naturally part of you. The immune system's job is to recognize and attack these 'non-self-antigenic' things, like viruses or bacteria. This word is mostly used by scientists and doctors when they talk about how the body defends itself against diseases."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The study focused on identifying non-self-antigenic peptides presented by cancer cells.","translation":"その研究は、がん細胞によって提示される非自己抗原性のペプチドの特定に焦点を当てていた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"immunology"},{"sentence":"Understanding the mechanisms of non-self-antigen recognition is crucial for developing effective vaccines.","translation":"非自己抗原認識のメカニズムを理解することは、効果的なワクチンを開発するために非常に重要である。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"immunology"}]}

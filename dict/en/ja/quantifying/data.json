It involves assigning a specific quantity or amount to a particular attribute or characteristic. This is often done to make data more objective and comparable. It is often used in scientific research, business analysis, and other fields where precise measurement is important. The opposite of 'quantifying' is 'qualifying', which involves describing something in terms of its qualities or characteristics rather than its quantity.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ We are quantifying the quality of the product.","correct":"✓ We are assessing the quality of the product. / ✓ We are quantifying the number of defects in the product.","note":"'Quality' is a qualitative aspect, so 'assessing' is more appropriate.

It's often used in technical or academic contexts when you need to measure or assess something precisely. For example, instead of saying 'the problem is big,' you might try 'quantifying' it by saying 'the problem affects 20% of users.' This makes the information more specific and easier to understand. It's important to use 'quantifying' when you want to be objective and avoid vague descriptions.

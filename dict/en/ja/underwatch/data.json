It is formed by combining the prefix 'under-' (meaning insufficient or less than) with the word 'watch' (meaning to observe or guard). Therefore, 'underwatch' means to watch or guard something inadequately or insufficiently. Due to its rarity, it is more common to use alternative phrases such as 'lack of supervision' or 'inadequate monitoring' to convey the same meaning. It is primarily used in formal or technical contexts when a specific term is needed to describe the failure to properly observe or guard something."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The museum's security system was criticized for its underwatch of valuable artifacts.","translation":"博物館のセキュリティシステムは、貴重な工芸品の監視が不十分であると批判された。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"監視不足"},{"sentence":"The lifeguard underwatched the swimming area, resulting in a near-drowning incident.","translation":"ライフガードが遊泳区域の監視を怠ったため、溺れかけた事故が発生した。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"監視が不十分である"}]}

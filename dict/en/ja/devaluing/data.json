'Value' comes from the Latin word 'valere,' meaning 'to be worth.' Therefore, 'devalue' literally means to reduce the worth or value of something.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/diːˈvæljuːɪŋ/","syllables":"de-val-u-ing (4 syllables)"},"inflection":{"verb_forms":{"present_participle":"devaluing","gerund":"devaluing"}},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Devaluing' is used in two main ways: as the present participle of the verb 'devalue' (e.g., 'They are devaluing the currency') and as a gerund (a verb acting as a noun) referring to the act of devaluing (e.g., 'The devaluing of education is a problem').

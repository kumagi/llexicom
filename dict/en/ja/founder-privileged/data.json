It refers to arrangements that give the founders of a company more control or benefits than they would normally have based on their equity ownership. This can be achieved through various mechanisms, such as dual-class share structures (where founders have shares with more voting rights than common shares), special board seats, or other contractual agreements. While founder-privileged structures can help founders maintain their vision and prevent short-term pressures, they can also raise concerns about accountability and potential conflicts of interest.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The company is privilege of the founder.","correct":"✓ The company is founder-privileged.","note":"The correct term is \"founder-privileged,\" not \"privilege of the founder.\""},{"incorrect":"✗ Founder privilege is always good for the company.","correct":"✓ Whether founder-privileged structures are beneficial depends on the specific context.","note":"Founder-privilege is not inherently good or bad; its effectiveness depends on the specific circumstances and the founder's leadership."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["founder (創業者)","privilege (特権)","privileged (特権を持つ)"],"related_terms":["dual-class shares","venture capital","startup","corporate governance","voting rights","control rights"],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"N/A","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency - Relatively uncommon, primarily used in business and finance contexts.","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"\"Founder-privileged\" is a term used in business, especially when talking about startups.

Instead, it may lead to a decreased resistance or even increased susceptibility to reinfection. This phenomenon is distinct from immune enhancement, where the immune response actually worsens the infection. Skeptophylaxis is often observed in certain viral infections and can have implications for vaccine development and immune strategies.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[],"priority":"☆☆☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":[],"phrasal_verbs":[],"priority":"☆☆☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"非常に低頻度 (Very low frequency) - 専門用語。","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C2","text":"\"Skeptophylaxis\" is a highly specialized term in immunology, referring to a decrease in resistance to reinfection after initial immunity has been acquired.

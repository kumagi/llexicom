It's about making sure that the assets you own will generate enough money to cover your future debts (liabilities). This is done by matching how long it takes for your assets to mature with how long it takes for your liabilities to come due. For example, if you have to pay out a certain amount of money in 20 years, you'd want to invest in assets that will mature around that same time. This helps protect against changes in interest rates that could affect the value of your assets and your ability to pay off your debts."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The consultant recommended a liability-matching approach to reduce the fund's exposure to interest rate volatility.","translation":"コンサルタントは、金利変動に対するファンドのエクスポージャーを減らすために、負債整合アプローチを推奨した。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"負債整合戦略"},{"sentence":"Effective liability-matching requires accurate forecasting of future cash flows.","translation":"効果的な負債整合には、将来のキャッシュフローの正確な予測が必要である。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"負債整合戦略"}]}

It is used to describe something, typically income or wealth, that has not been acquired through effort or labor. Because of its infrequent use, it is more likely to be encountered in legal or financial contexts. It is formed by adding the prefix 'un-' to 'yearned', where 'yearned' is used in the sense of 'earned' rather than 'longed for'. It is important to distinguish this word from the more common verb 'to yearn', which means to have a strong desire for something."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The company's unyearned revenue was projected to increase in the next quarter.","translation":"その会社のまだ得られていない収益は、次の四半期に増加すると予測されました。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"Not yet earned"},{"sentence":"He inherited a large sum of unyearned wealth.","translation":"彼は多額のまだ稼いでいない財産を相続しました。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"Not yet earned"},{"sentence":"The politician was criticized for advocating policies that favored unyearned gains.","translation":"その政治家は、まだ得られていない利益を優遇する政策を提唱したとして批判されました。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"Not yet earned"}]}

It describes a system or application that can work with data without needing to know the specific structure (schema) of that data in advance. This is useful when dealing with data that changes frequently or comes from different sources with varying formats. Think of it as a universal adapter that can handle different types of plugs without needing to be configured for each one. While it offers flexibility, it also means that the system needs to be smart enough to figure out the data structure on its own when processing the data.

Saint Audrey (Etheldreda) was an Anglo-Saxon saint known for her simple and modest lifestyle. After her death, cheap, showy necklaces and trinkets were sold at the Saint Audrey's Fair in Ely, England. These items, in stark contrast to the saint's reputation, became known as 'tawdry laces,' and eventually, anything cheap and showy was described as 'tawdry.'","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/ˈtɔːdriɪst/","syllables":"taw-dri-est"},"inflection":{"adjective_forms":{"comparative":"more tawdry","superlative":"tawdriest"}},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Tawdriest' is the superlative form of 'tawdry,' meaning the most excessively showy, cheap, and lacking in good taste.

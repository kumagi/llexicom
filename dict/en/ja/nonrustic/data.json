Therefore, \"nonrustic\" describes something that is the opposite: urban, sophisticated, polished, and not reminiscent of rural life. Because it is a less common word, it is more likely to be encountered in formal writing or when a speaker wants to use a precise term to contrast something with a rural or rustic aesthetic."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The restaurant had a decidedly **nonrustic** ambiance, with its sleek metal furnishings and minimalist decor.","translation":"そのレストランは、洗練された金属製の家具とミニマリストな内装で、明らかに非田舎的な雰囲気を持っていた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"都会的な雰囲気"},{"sentence":"She found the **nonrustic** environment of the city more stimulating than the quiet countryside.","translation":"彼女は、静かな田舎よりも、都会の非田舎的な環境の方が刺激的だと感じた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"都会的な環境"}]}

Because of its rarity and the need to understand the base word 'ditch,' it's best suited for advanced English speakers and writers. It's most often used in contexts where the lack of abandonment or discarding is noteworthy.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The project, surprisingly, remained unditched despite the budget cuts.","translation":"驚くべきことに、そのプロジェクトは予算削減にもかかわらず、見捨てられることはなかった。","type":"verb (past participle)","meaning_category":"見捨てられなかった"},{"sentence":"She was grateful to feel unditched by her family during her illness.","translation":"彼女は病気の時、家族に見捨てられなかったことに感謝した。","type":"verb (past participle)","meaning_category":"見捨てられなかった"},{"sentence":"The valuable artifact remained unditched in the dusty attic for decades.","translation":"その貴重な工芸品は、何十年もの間、埃っぽい屋根裏部屋で溝に落とされることもなく残っていた。","type":"verb (past participle)","meaning_category":"溝に落とされなかった"}]}

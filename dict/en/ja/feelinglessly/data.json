'Feelingless' is composed of 'feeling' (from the verb 'to feel', originating from Proto-Germanic *fēlanan) and the suffix '-less' (meaning 'without'). Thus, 'feelinglessly' literally means 'without feeling' or 'in a manner devoid of feeling'.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/ˈfiːlɪŋləsli/","syllables":"feel-ing-less-ly"},"inflection":{"notes":"Adverbs do not inflect."},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Feelinglessly' describes an action or manner that lacks emotional depth, empathy, or sensitivity.

It is often used in contexts where arguments, evidence, or testimonies are being evaluated for their ability to persuade or establish truth.

It's used when evaluating the strength of arguments, evidence, or presentations. For example, you might say that a lawyer's closing argument had a high degree of convincingness, meaning it was very likely to persuade the jury. The word is formed by adding the suffix '-ness' to the adjective 'convincing', which itself comes from the verb 'convince'. Because it's a more formal and abstract term, it's less common in everyday conversation and more often found in academic or professional contexts."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The **convincingness** of her apology made it easy to forgive her.","translation":"彼女の謝罪の説得力は、彼女を許すことを容易にした。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"説得力"},{"sentence":"The report's **convincingness** was undermined by several factual errors.","translation":"報告書の説得力は、いくつかの事実誤認によって損なわれた。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"説得力"},{"sentence":"We need to improve the **convincingness** of our marketing campaign.","translation":"我々はマーケティングキャンペーンの説得力を向上させる必要がある。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"説得力"}]}

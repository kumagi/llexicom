It is particularly useful in detecting corneal irregularities, such as those caused by astigmatism, keratoconus, or corneal scarring. The procedure can be performed using various instruments, including a Placido disk (a handheld device with concentric rings that are reflected on the cornea) or more advanced computer-assisted corneal topography systems. The results of keratoscopy can help ophthalmologists and optometrists in diagnosing and managing various corneal conditions, as well as in fitting contact lenses.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Keratoscopy is a treatment for eye disease.","correct":"✓ Keratoscopy is a diagnostic tool for eye disease.","note":"Keratoscopy is a diagnostic procedure, not a treatment.

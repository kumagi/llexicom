Phagocytes are cells that protect the body by engulfing harmful substances.

This term is typically encountered in advanced scientific texts and research papers.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"Bacterial toxins can induce phagocytolysis, weakening the host's immune response.","translation":"細菌毒素は食細胞溶解を誘導し、宿主の免疫応答を弱める可能性がある。","type":"scientific","meaning_category":"cell destruction"},{"sentence":"The researchers studied the role of specific enzymes in the process of phagocytolysis.","translation":"研究者たちは食細胞溶解の過程における特定の酵素の役割を研究した。","type":"research","meaning_category":"cell destruction"}]}

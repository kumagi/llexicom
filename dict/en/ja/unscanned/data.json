The verb 'scan' comes from Latin 'scandere' meaning 'to climb, mount gradually'. In the 20th century, 'scan' took on the meaning of examining something closely or converting it into digital form.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/ʌnˈskænd/","syllables":"un-scanned"},"inflection":{"notes":"As an adjective, 'unscanned' does not have comparative or superlative forms."},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Unscanned' is used to describe something that has not undergone the process of scanning. This can refer to either the act of converting a physical item into a digital format (e.g., an unscanned document) or the act of examining something with a scanner, often for security purposes (e.g., unscanned luggage).

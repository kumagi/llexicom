It's formed by adding the prefix \"super-\" to the word \"edify,\" which means to instruct or improve someone morally or intellectually. Because of its rarity, it's unlikely to be encountered in everyday conversation or writing. It's primarily used for emphasis or humor. Understanding the etymology of the word (super- + edify) is helpful in deciphering its meaning.","priority":"★☆☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The sermon superedified the congregation, leaving them with a renewed sense of purpose.","translation":"説教は信徒たちを大いに啓発し、彼らに新たな目的意識をもたらした。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"uplift morally"},{"sentence":"She hoped that her experiences abroad would superedify her understanding of different cultures.","translation":"彼女は海外での経験が、異なる文化に対する彼女の理解を大いに深めることを願った。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"improve intellectually"}]}

A gyroscope is a device consisting of a wheel or disc mounted so that it can spin rapidly about an axis which can turn freely in all directions. A compass is an instrument containing a magnetized pointer which shows the direction of magnetic north and bearings from it.","priority":"★★★"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/ˈdʒaɪroʊˌkʌmpəs/","syllables":"gy-ro-com-pass"},"inflection":{"noun_plural":"gyrocompasses"},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"A gyrocompass is a type of non-magnetic compass that is based on a fast-spinning gyroscope and the Earth's rotation to find true north. Unlike magnetic compasses, gyrocompasses are not affected by magnetic fields, making them more reliable in certain environments, such as near the Earth's poles or on steel ships. They are often used in navigation on ships and aircraft.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The gyro compass showed the way.","correct":"✓ The gyrocompass showed the way.","note":"\"Gyrocompass\" is one word.

Polyclonal antibodies are a mixture of antibodies produced by different B cell clones, each recognizing a different epitope (specific site) on the same antigen. This contrasts with monoclonal antibodies, which are produced by a single clone and recognize only one epitope. Polyclonal antibodies are generally easier and cheaper to produce but can have batch-to-batch variability.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The antibody was polyclone.","correct":"✓ The antibody was polyclonal.","note":"'Polyclone' is not a standard term.

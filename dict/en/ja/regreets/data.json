What tidings can you tell me of my lord?\" \"He is not yet arrived: nor know I aught But that he's well and will be shortly here.\" \"O! but I fear - How lost you company?\" \"The great contention of the sea and skies Parted our fellowship - But, hark! a sail. [Within] A sail, a sail! [Guns heard]\" \"They give their greeting to the citadel: This likewise is a friend.\" \"See for the news! [Exit Gentleman] Good ancient, you are welcome.

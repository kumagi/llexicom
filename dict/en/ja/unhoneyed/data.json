Literally, it means \"not sweetened with honey,\" but more often it's used figuratively to describe something (usually speech or an opinion) that is direct, blunt, and not sugar-coated. It implies a lack of flattery or a willingness to be critical. Because of its relatively low frequency and nuanced meaning, it's more likely to be encountered in formal writing or sophisticated conversation."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The unhoneyed truth was difficult to hear, but necessary.","translation":"辛辣な真実は聞くのが難しかったが、必要だった。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"辛辣な"},{"sentence":"He offered an unhoneyed critique of her performance.","translation":"彼は彼女のパフォーマンスについて率直な批評をした。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"率直な"},{"sentence":"She served unhoneyed lemonade, preferring the tartness of the lemons.","translation":"彼女は蜂蜜を入れないレモネードを出し、レモンの酸味を好んだ。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"甘くない"}]}

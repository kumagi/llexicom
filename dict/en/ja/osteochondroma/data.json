They typically occur in the metaphysis (the region between the epiphysis and diaphysis) of long bones, such as the femur, tibia, and humerus. They usually stop growing when the growth plates close at the end of puberty. While most are solitary, some individuals have multiple osteochondromas, a condition known as multiple hereditary exostoses (MHE).

They are also known as semi-metals. The exact number of metalloids varies depending on the criteria used, but the most commonly recognized metalloids are boron (B), silicon (Si), germanium (Ge), arsenic (As), antimony (Sb), and tellurium (Te). Polonium (Po) and astatine (At) are sometimes also considered metalloids.

It describes a situation where an investment portfolio has too many different assets, often resulting in lower returns and increased management complexity. The idea is that by spreading investments too thinly, potential gains are diluted, and the benefits of diversification diminish. It's the opposite of having a concentrated portfolio, where investments are focused on a smaller number of assets.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The company overdiversified their product line and lost focus.","correct":"✓ The company diversified their product line too much and lost focus.","note":"While \"overdiversified\" is technically correct in this context, it's more commonly used for investment portfolios.

This can be a problem because it can reduce the potential for high returns. It's like spreading your money too thin – you might not lose a lot if one investment does poorly, but you also won't gain much if one does really well. It's important to find the right balance between diversification and concentration in your investments.

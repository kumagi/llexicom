This group is analogous to the carbonyl group (C=O) but with sulfur replacing oxygen. Thiocarbonyl compounds are generally less stable than their carbonyl counterparts due to the weaker pi bond between carbon and sulfur compared to carbon and oxygen. They are important in organic chemistry and are used in various applications.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ thiocarbonile","correct":"✓ thiocarbonyl","note":"The correct spelling is 'thiocarbonyl', not 'thiocarbonile'."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["thiocarbonyl compound","thiocarbonyl ylide"],"phrasal_verbs":[]},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Thiocarbonyl' is a technical term used in organic chemistry to describe a functional group consisting of a carbon atom double-bonded to a sulfur atom (C=S).

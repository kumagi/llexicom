It acts like a switch, selecting one of several input signals and directing it to a single output. The selection is controlled by a set of select lines. Multiplexors are crucial for reducing the number of physical channels needed to transmit multiple streams of data, saving resources and simplifying circuit designs. They are used in various applications, including data communication, telecommunications, and computer systems.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The multiplexor demultiplexes the signal.","correct":"✓ The multiplexor multiplexes the signal.","note":"A multiplexor multiplexes (combines) signals, while a demultiplexor demultiplexes (separates) them.

Imagine you have several different streams of information, and you want to send only one of them at a time through a single wire. A multiplexor lets you choose which stream to send. It has multiple inputs (the different streams of information), one output (the single wire), and some select lines (controls that determine which input is connected to the output). It's a key component in digital electronics and communication systems for managing and routing data efficiently.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The 4-to-1 multiplexor selects one of four input lines based on the two select lines.","translation":"4対1のマルチプレクサは、2つのセレクトラインに基づいて4つの入力ラインのうちの1つを選択します。","type":"general","meaning_category":"function"},{"sentence":"Using a multiplexor reduces the number of pins required on the integrated circuit.","translation":"マルチプレクサを使用すると、集積回路に必要なピンの数を減らすことができます。","type":"application","meaning_category":"advantage"},{"sentence":"The communication system employs a multiplexor to transmit multiple signals over a single channel.","translation":"その通信システムは、単一のチャネルを介して複数の信号を送信するためにマルチプレクサを使用しています。","type":"system design","meaning_category":"implementation"}]}

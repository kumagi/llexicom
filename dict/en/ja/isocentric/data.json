In geometry, it describes shapes or objects sharing a common center. In physics and materials science, especially crystallography, it refers to materials having uniform properties in all directions (isotropic). In radiation therapy, 'isocentric' refers to techniques where the radiation beam is rotated around a fixed point (the isocenter) within the patient's body, allowing for precise targeting of the tumor while minimizing damage to surrounding tissues.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The design was eccentric, not isocentric.","correct":"✓ The design was eccentric, not concentric.","note":"Eccentric means not having a common center, while isocentric (or concentric) means having a common center.

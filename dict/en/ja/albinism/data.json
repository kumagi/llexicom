This results in very light or white skin and hair, and often affects vision due to the lack of pigment in the eyes. The condition is inherited, meaning it is passed down through genes from parents to their children. Individuals with albinism are more susceptible to sun damage and have an increased risk of skin cancer. While there is no cure for albinism, management focuses on protecting the skin and eyes from the sun and addressing any vision problems. It is important to remember that albinism is a genetic condition and not a disease.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The child was born with albinism, resulting in very pale skin and white hair.","translation":"その子供はアルビノ症を持って生まれ、非常に色の薄い肌と白い髪になった。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"genetic condition"},{"sentence":"Albinism can affect vision due to the lack of pigment in the eyes.","translation":"アルビノ症は、目の色素の欠如により視力に影響を与えることがある。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"effect on vision"},{"sentence":"People with albinism need to take extra precautions to protect their skin from the sun.","translation":"アルビノ症の人は、太陽から肌を守るために特別な予防措置を講じる必要がある。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"skin protection"}]}

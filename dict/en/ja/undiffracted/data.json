It describes a wave (such as light or X-rays) that has not been subjected to diffraction, meaning it has not been bent or spread out as it passes through an obstacle or aperture. It is often used in contrast to 'diffracted' to distinguish between the portions of a wave that have and have not undergone diffraction.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The undiffracted light was scattered.","correct":"✓ The undiffracted light was not scattered.","note":"Undiffracted means it has not been scattered or diffracted.

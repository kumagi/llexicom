It is primarily used in the United States, particularly in rural areas or to evoke a folksy or old-timey feel. It's considered a euphemism, meaning it's a less offensive substitute for a stronger curse word (in this case, \"goddamn\"). It's not likely to offend anyone, but it might sound a bit quaint or humorous to modern ears.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ He goldurned the car.","correct":"✓ (No correct usage, as it's primarily an interjection)","note":"\"Goldurn\" is almost exclusively used as an interjection, not as a verb or other part of speech."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":[],"phrasal_verbs":[],"related_terms":["goddamn","damn","darn","dang","gosh","golly","gee"],"priority":"★☆☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"N/A (slang, not typically taught)","frequency_google_ngram":"Very low frequency; becoming increasingly rare.","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C2","text":"\"Goldurn\" is a very informal and dated expression, primarily found in older American literature or speech.

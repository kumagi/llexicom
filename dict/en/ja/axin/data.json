This pathway is involved in embryonic development, cell proliferation, and differentiation. Axin functions as a scaffold protein, bringing together other proteins to form a complex that regulates the levels of beta-catenin, a key signaling molecule in the pathway. Because of its role in regulating cell growth, Axin is also implicated in cancer development.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Axin is a type of cell.","correct":"✓ Axin is a protein.","note":"Axin is a protein, not a cell."},{"incorrect":"✗ Axin regulates all signaling pathways.","correct":"✓ Axin regulates the Wnt signaling pathway.","note":"Axin specifically regulates the Wnt signaling pathway."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["AXIN1","AXIN2","Wnt signaling","beta-catenin"],"phrasal_verbs":["None (typically used in specific biochemical contexts)"],"priority":"★★★"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2 (specialized scientific vocabulary)","frequency_google_ngram":"Low (specific scientific term)","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Axin' is a technical term used in molecular biology, specifically related to the Wnt signaling pathway.

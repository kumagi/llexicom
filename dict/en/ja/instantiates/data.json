It refers to the process of creating a specific object (an instance) from a class blueprint. The class defines the properties and methods, while the instance is a concrete realization of that class with specific values assigned to its properties. It can also be used more broadly to describe the act of making something concrete or real from an abstract idea.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The idea instantiates in my mind.","correct":"✓ The idea is instantiated in the design.","note":"'Instantiate' is generally used when creating a concrete instance from a class or template, not just when an idea comes to mind.

It means to create a specific object from a class. Think of a class as a blueprint and the object as the actual thing built from that blueprint. For example, if you have a class called 'Car', instantiating it would create a specific car with its own properties like color and model. This term is commonly used when discussing object-oriented programming.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The factory class **instantiates** product objects based on the configuration.","translation":"ファクトリークラスは、構成に基づいて製品オブジェクトをインスタンス化します。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"プログラミング"},{"sentence":"The system **instantiates** a new process for each incoming request.","translation":"システムは、受信リクエストごとに新しいプロセスをインスタンス化します。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"プログラミング"},{"sentence":"The software **instantiates** the report template with the latest data.","translation":"ソフトウェアは、最新のデータでレポートテンプレートをインスタンス化します。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"プログラミング"}]}

Imagine drawing a line from one corner to the opposite corner of a square or rectangle. That line divides the quadrangle into two triangles. Each of those triangles can be called a semiquadrangle. This term is mainly used in technical contexts like geometry or surveying. Because it's not a common word, you probably won't hear it often unless you're studying these subjects.","priority":"★☆☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"Each semiquadrangle within the larger shape had to be measured precisely.","translation":"大きな図形内の各半四辺形は正確に測定する必要があった。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"geometry"},{"sentence":"The field was divided into two semiquadrangles by a fence running diagonally across it.","translation":"その畑は、対角線上に走るフェンスによって2つの半四辺形に分割された。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"surveying"}]}

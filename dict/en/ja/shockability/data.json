This can be in a literal, electrical sense, or in a figurative, emotional sense. In electrical contexts, it describes a material's or object's capacity to conduct electricity and cause a shock. In emotional contexts, it describes a person's tendency to be easily disturbed or offended by something. It is a relatively uncommon word, often replaced by more common terms like 'sensitivity' or 'susceptibility'.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The shockability of the news was very high for him.","correct":"✓ The shocking nature of the news was very impactful for him. / ✓ He was very shocked by the news.","note":"'Shockability' is a quality of something, not a direct experience of a person.

It describes the manner in which something lacks the properties of gelatin, meaning it does not have a jelly-like or viscous consistency. Due to its specialized usage, it is not commonly encountered in general language. Understanding the root words 'non-' (not) and 'gelatinous' (jelly-like) is essential to grasp its meaning.

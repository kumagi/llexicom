It suggests a state of being overwhelmed by the positive emotions of a new relationship, similar to being 'struck' by lightning or love. The word can also imply a naive or idealistic view of the relationship, as if the person is still under the spell of the honeymoon period and not fully aware of potential challenges. Because of its relative rarity and nuanced meaning, it is more likely to be encountered in advanced or literary contexts."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The couple was completely honeymoonstruck, unable to see any flaws in each other.","translation":"そのカップルは完全に新婚旅行気分で、お互いの欠点を何も見ることができなかった。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"新婚旅行中の幸福感"},{"sentence":"His honeymoonstruck optimism about the business venture worried his more cautious partners.","translation":"彼の事業への新婚旅行のような楽観主義は、より慎重なパートナーたちを心配させた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"現実が見えていない"}]}

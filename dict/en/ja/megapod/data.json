They are known for building large mounds of vegetation, sand, or soil in which they bury their eggs. The heat generated by the decomposing vegetation or the warmth of the soil incubates the eggs. The chicks are precocial, meaning they are relatively independent at hatching and can fly shortly after emerging from the nest.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ I saw a megapode in the garden.","correct":"✓ I saw a megapod in the garden.","note":"The correct spelling is 'megapod', not 'megapode'."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["Megapodiidae (family name)"],"phrasal_verbs":[]},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"B2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"The term 'megapod' refers to a specific family of birds found in the Australasian region. These birds are notable for their unique nesting behavior, where they incubate their eggs in mounds of decaying vegetation or warm soil, rather than sitting on them directly. Understanding the term requires some knowledge of ornithology or zoology. The word itself is derived from Greek roots meaning 'large foot,' which is a physical characteristic of these birds that aids in mound-building."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The **megapod** carefully constructs its nesting mound.","translation":"ツカツクリは注意深く巣塚を構築します。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"塚を作る鳥"},{"sentence":"Conservation efforts are crucial to protect **megapod** habitats.","translation":"ツカツクリの生息地を保護するためには、保全活動が不可欠です。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"塚を作る鳥"}]}

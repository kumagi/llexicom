It is primarily used in the context of chemistry, biochemistry, and related fields to describe the process of removing a substance from a mixture by washing it with a solvent. This is commonly used in chromatography, where different substances are separated based on their affinity for a stationary phase, and then selectively eluted using different solvents. The term implies a controlled and selective removal process.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The solvent is eluting the compound.","correct":"✓ The solvent is eluting the compound from the column.","note":"It's important to specify where the substance is being eluted from (e.g., a column, a matrix)."},{"incorrect":"✗ The compound is eluting.","correct":"✓ The compound is being eluted.","note":"When used in the passive voice, 'eluting' should be 'being eluted' to indicate that the process is being done to the compound."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["elute (verb)","elution (noun)","eluent (noun)","eluate (noun)"],"priority":"★★★"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C1","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency - Primarily used in scientific contexts.","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Eluting' is a technical term used in chemistry and biochemistry.

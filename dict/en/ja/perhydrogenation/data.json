This process is often used to convert unsaturated fats into saturated fats, but can also be applied to other organic compounds. The reaction usually requires a catalyst, such as nickel or palladium, and is carried out under high temperature and pressure to facilitate the addition of hydrogen atoms.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The perhydrogenation was made by oxygen.","correct":"✓ The perhydrogenation was made by hydrogen.","note":"Perhydrogenation involves the addition of hydrogen, not oxygen."},{"incorrect":"✗ Perhydrogenation is the same as dehydration.","correct":"✓ Perhydrogenation is the opposite of dehydrogenation.","note":"Perhydrogenation adds hydrogen, while dehydration removes water, and dehydrogenation removes hydrogen."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":[],"phrasal_verbs":[]},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C2","text":"'Perhydrogenation' is a technical term primarily used in advanced chemistry contexts.

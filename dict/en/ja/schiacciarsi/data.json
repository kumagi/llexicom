It's used when something or someone is flattened or pressed tightly. It's a reflexive verb, so it always needs a reflexive pronoun (mi, ti, si, ci, vi). It's important to remember to use the auxiliary verb 'essere' (to be) when forming compound tenses, like the passato prossimo (e.g., 'Mi sono schiacciato'). The word is often used in everyday situations to describe being in a crowded place or pressing oneself against something."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"Il pacco si è schiacciato durante il trasporto.","translation":"The package got crushed during transport.","type":"verb","meaning_category":"being crushed"},{"sentence":"Mi sono schiacciato contro il sedile per far passare gli altri.","translation":"I squeezed myself against the seat to let others pass.","type":"verb","meaning_category":"squeezing oneself"},{"sentence":"Si sono schiacciati tutti in ascensore.","translation":"They all squeezed into the elevator.","type":"verb","meaning_category":"cramming oneself"}]}

'Eludere' is composed of 'e-' (meaning 'out of') and 'ludere' (meaning 'to play'). Therefore, 'elusive' originally suggested something that slips away like a game or play. The adverbial form 'elusively' simply adds the '-ly' suffix to indicate the manner in which something is elusive.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/ɪˈluːsɪvli/","syllables":"e-lu-sive-ly"},"inflection":{"notes":"As an adverb, 'elusively' does not have different forms for gender, number, or case."},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Elusively' describes something that is difficult to grasp, either physically or mentally. It often implies a sense of something being just out of reach, or difficult to define or understand precisely. The term can be used to describe abstract concepts (like happiness or meaning), sensory experiences (like a scent or sound), or even physical objects that are hard to find or catch.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ He elusively avoided the question direct.","correct":"✓ He elusively avoided the question directly.","note":"The adverb 'directly' should be used instead of the adjective 'direct' to modify the verb 'avoided'."},{"incorrect":"✗ The answer was elusive, so I understood it elusively.","correct":"✓ The answer was elusive, so I understood it with difficulty.","note":"'Elusively' describes the manner in which something *is*, not the manner in which someone *understands* something.

It's often used in more sophisticated writing to describe abstract concepts or subtle qualities. For example, you might say that a scent drifted 'elusively' through the air, meaning it was hard to pinpoint or hold onto. Or, you might say that a solution to a problem remained 'elusively' out of reach, meaning it was difficult to grasp or achieve. It's a word that adds nuance and complexity to descriptions.","example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The truth about his past remained **elusively** hidden.","translation":"彼の過去についての真実は、捉えどころなく隠されたままだった。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"捉えどころなく隠された"},{"sentence":"The melody of the song floated **elusively** in her memory.","translation":"その歌のメロディーは、彼女の記憶の中で捉えどころなく漂った。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"捉えどころなく漂った"},{"sentence":"The artist captured the light **elusively** in his painting.","translation":"その芸術家は、絵の中で光を捉えどころなく表現した。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"捉えどころなく表現した"},{"sentence":"The politician answered the questions **elusively**, avoiding a direct response.","translation":"その政治家は、直接的な回答を避け、質問に捉えどころなく答えた。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"曖昧に答えた"}]}}

'Squawky' itself means making a loud, harsh noise, like a bird squawking, or prone to complaining loudly. Therefore, 'squawkiest' is used to describe the loudest or most complaining example of something within a group. Due to its specific meaning and relatively infrequent use, it is more likely to be encountered by advanced English learners or native speakers."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"That old door has the squawkiest hinges; I can hear it open from downstairs.","translation":"あの古いドアは蝶番が一番うるさい。階下から開くのが聞こえる。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"Sound"},{"sentence":"Of all the children, she was always the squawkiest when she didn't get her way.","translation":"子供たちの中で、彼女はいつも自分の思い通りにならないとき、一番文句を言う人だった。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"Complaining"},{"sentence":"The squawkiest wheel on the shopping cart made it difficult to steer.","translation":"ショッピングカートの一番うるさい車輪は、操縦を困難にした。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"Sound"},{"sentence":"The squawkiest voice in the debate often drowned out the more reasonable arguments.","translation":"討論会で最も騒々しい声は、しばしばより合理的な議論をかき消した。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"Complaining"}]}

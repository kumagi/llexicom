Plasticity, in materials science, is the ability of a solid material to undergo permanent deformation, a non-reversible change of shape in response to applied forces. A material exhibiting nonplasticity will either deform elastically (reversibly) or fracture when subjected to stress. This term is often used in the context of materials science, engineering, and geology.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The clay showed high nonplasticity.","correct":"✓ The clay showed low plasticity.","note":"Clays are generally known for their plasticity. To describe a clay that is not very plastic, it's more accurate to say it has 'low plasticity' rather than 'high nonplasticity'."},{"incorrect":"✗ Nonplasticity is good for bending metal.","correct":"✓ Plasticity is good for bending metal.","note":"Bending metal requires plasticity, not nonplasticity.

Plasticity is the ability of a material to change shape permanently without breaking. Therefore, a material with \"nonplasticity\" will either return to its original shape when force is removed (elasticity) or break. This term is primarily used in scientific and engineering contexts.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The high silica content contributed to the nonplasticity of the rock.","translation":"シリカ含有量が高いことが、その岩石の非可塑性に寄与していた。","type":"general","meaning_category":"materials science"},{"sentence":"The engineer considered the nonplasticity of the concrete when designing the bridge supports.","translation":"エンジニアは橋の支柱を設計する際に、コンクリートの非可塑性を考慮した。","type":"engineering","meaning_category":"engineering"},{"sentence":"The nonplasticity of the sample made it unsuitable for the intended application.","translation":"そのサンプルの非可塑性のため、意図した用途には適していなかった。","type":"general","meaning_category":"materials science"}]}

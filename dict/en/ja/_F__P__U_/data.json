These numbers are used to represent non-integer values, such as decimals or very large or small numbers. The FPU is crucial for applications that require complex mathematical operations, such as scientific simulations, 3D graphics, and engineering software. Modern CPUs often have an integrated FPU, while older systems may have had a separate math coprocessor to handle these calculations. Understanding the role of the FPU is essential for comprehending the architecture and performance of computer systems, especially in fields that heavily rely on numerical computations."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The performance of the simulation was significantly improved by using a dedicated FPU.","translation":"専用のFPUを使用することで、シミュレーションのパフォーマンスが大幅に向上しました。","type":"general","meaning_category":"浮動小数点演算装置"},{"sentence":"The FPU in this processor supports advanced mathematical functions.","translation":"このプロセッサのFPUは、高度な数学関数をサポートしています。","type":"technical","meaning_category":"浮動小数点演算装置"}]}

Its primary purpose is to counteract hogging, a type of stress where the ends of the ship are supported by waves while the middle is unsupported, causing the ship to bend upwards. The hog-frame provides longitudinal strength to resist this bending.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The hog-frame is used to prevent sagging.","correct":"✓ The hog-frame is used to prevent hogging.","note":"A hog-frame prevents 'hogging' (bending upwards), not 'sagging' (bending downwards)."},{"incorrect":"✗ Hog-frames are only used in modern steel ships.","correct":"✓ Hog-frames were traditionally used in wooden ships, but modern steel ships use different structural designs.","note":"Hog-frames are more associated with older wooden ship construction.

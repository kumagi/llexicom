It often carries a negative connotation, suggesting a reduction in quality, purity, or authenticity. It's important to note that while 'genetically modified' can sometimes be a synonym, 'DNA-adulterated' often implies a less controlled or even illicit alteration, whereas 'genetically modified' usually refers to deliberate and regulated genetic engineering.","priority":"Medium"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"The DNA was adulterated by a virus.","correct":"The DNA was contaminated by a virus.","note":"While 'adulterated' could technically apply, 'contaminated' is more commonly used to describe DNA that has been affected by external biological agents like viruses or bacteria."},{"incorrect":"The DNA-adulterated food is safe to eat.","correct":"The genetically modified food is safe to eat.","note":"If the DNA alteration is intentional and regulated (e.g., genetic modification), it is more appropriate to use 'genetically modified.'

Understanding its meaning requires familiarity with molecular biology concepts, particularly DNA and genetic modification. The term implies that DNA has been altered or contaminated in a way that compromises its purity or quality, often raising concerns about safety or authenticity. Due to its specialized nature, it is unlikely to be encountered in general conversation or non-technical texts."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The investigation focused on identifying DNA-adulterated samples in the research study.","translation":"調査は、研究におけるDNA改ざんされたサンプルの特定に焦点を当てた。","type":"general","meaning_category":"DNA改ざんされたサンプル"},{"sentence":"The company faced legal action for selling DNA-adulterated products to consumers.","translation":"その企業は、DNAが不正に操作された製品を消費者に販売したとして法的措置に直面した。","type":"legal","meaning_category":"DNAが不正に操作された製品"},{"sentence":"The scientist discovered that the cell line was DNA-adulterated, leading to inaccurate experimental results.","translation":"科学者は、細胞株がDNA混入されていることを発見し、実験結果の不正確さにつながった。","type":"scientific","meaning_category":"DNA混入された細胞株"}]}

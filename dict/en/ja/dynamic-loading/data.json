It is commonly used in modern software development to create modular and extensible applications. It contrasts with static linking, where all code is linked together at compile time. Dynamic loading offers advantages such as reduced memory footprint, faster startup times, and the ability to update or extend functionality without recompiling the entire application. However, it also introduces complexities such as managing dependencies and potential runtime errors.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ dynamic loading is when the program is already running and you load things","correct":"✓ Dynamic loading is when the program is running and you load things as needed.","note":"The key aspect of dynamic loading is that it happens *during* program execution and *as needed*, not just when the program is running."},{"incorrect":"✗ dynamic loading is the same as static linking","correct":"✓ Dynamic loading is the opposite of static linking.","note":"Dynamic loading and static linking are fundamentally different approaches to linking code.

It refers to a process where a program doesn't load all the necessary code at the beginning. Instead, it waits until it actually needs a specific part of the code (like a library or module) and then loads it. This can make programs start faster and use less memory. It's often used for things like plugins, where you can add new features to a program without changing the original code. Understanding this term requires some background knowledge of how programs are built and run."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The game engine uses dynamic-loading to load different levels as the player progresses.","translation":"そのゲームエンジンは、プレイヤーの進行に合わせて異なるレベルを動的ローディングで読み込みます。","type":"general","meaning_category":"use case"},{"sentence":"Implementing dynamic-loading requires careful management of dependencies.","translation":"動的ローディングを実装するには、依存関係の慎重な管理が必要です。","type":"technical","meaning_category":"implementation"},{"sentence":"Dynamic-loading can improve the modularity and maintainability of large software projects.","translation":"動的ローディングは、大規模なソフトウェアプロジェクトのモジュール性と保守性を向上させることができます。","type":"advantage","meaning_category":"benefits"}]}

It describes systems, applications, or components that are designed to be independent of specific services or vendors. This approach promotes interoperability, flexibility, and portability, as the system can be easily adapted to work with different services without requiring significant modifications. It is often used to avoid vendor lock-in, where a system becomes tightly coupled with a specific vendor's services, making it difficult to switch to alternative solutions.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The software is service-agnostic to the database.","correct":"✓ The software is service-agnostic and can work with any database.","note":"It's better to explain what the service-agnostic component *does* rather than saying it's 'agnostic to' something.

Think of it like a universal remote control that can operate different brands of TVs. In software and IT, being service-agnostic means a system or application can easily switch between different providers (like cloud services) without needing major changes. This is useful for avoiding being stuck with one provider and for making systems more flexible and adaptable. It's a term mainly used by people in the technology field."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The company adopted a service-agnostic approach to cloud infrastructure.","translation":"その会社は、クラウドインフラストラクチャに対してサービスに依存しないアプローチを採用しました。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"サービスに依存しない"},{"sentence":"A service-agnostic API allows developers to integrate with multiple payment gateways.","translation":"サービスに依存しないAPIを使用すると、開発者は複数の決済ゲートウェイと統合できます。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"サービスに依存しない"},{"sentence":"The new platform is designed to be service-agnostic, ensuring compatibility with future technologies.","translation":"新しいプラットフォームは、将来のテクノロジーとの互換性を確保するために、サービスに依存しないように設計されています。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"サービスに依存しない"}]}

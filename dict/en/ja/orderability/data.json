This is a key concept in mathematics, computer science, and logic. It's often used in the context of data structures, algorithms, and database systems where the ability to sort and retrieve data in a predictable sequence is essential. The term implies that a consistent and reliable method exists for comparing and ranking the items in question.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The orderability is important for the algorithm.","correct":"✓ Orderability is important for the algorithm.","note":"In many cases, using \"orderability\" as a general property is correct without the article \"the\".

It's used in fields like math and computer science. If something has orderability, it means there's a way to compare any two items and decide which one comes first. This is important for things like sorting lists or organizing data in a database. It's not a word you'd use in everyday conversation, but it's important for understanding certain technical topics."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The **orderability** of the elements in the array allows for efficient binary search.","translation":"配列内の要素の順序付け可能性により、効率的な二分探索が可能になります。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"順序付け可能性"},{"sentence":"The lack of **orderability** in the data made it difficult to analyze.","translation":"データの順序付け可能性の欠如により、分析が困難になりました。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"順序付け可能性"},{"sentence":"The system relies on the **orderability** of timestamps to process events in the correct sequence.","translation":"そのシステムは、イベントを正しい順序で処理するために、タイムスタンプの順序付け可能性に依存しています。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"順序付け可能性"}]}

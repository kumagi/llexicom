It is often used in discussions about complex systems, policies, or materials where it is important to know how things work or what is happening. The word is formed by adding the prefix \"non-\" to \"transparency,\" which means the opposite: being clear and easy to see through, both literally and figuratively. Because it is a more formal and less common word, simpler alternatives like \"lack of clarity\" or \"opacity\" may be preferred in everyday conversation."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The committee criticized the **nontransparency** of the bidding process.","translation":"委員会は入札プロセスの不透明性を批判した。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"lack of openness"},{"sentence":"The **nontransparency** of the material is essential for maintaining privacy.","translation":"その素材の不透明性は、プライバシーを維持するために不可欠である。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"opacity"},{"sentence":"The **nontransparency** of the financial markets contributed to the economic crisis.","translation":"金融市場の不透明性が経済危機の一因となった。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"lack of clarity in finance"},{"sentence":"The **nontransparency** of the instructions made it difficult to assemble the furniture.","translation":"説明書のわかりにくさが、家具の組み立てを困難にした。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"difficulty in understanding"}]}

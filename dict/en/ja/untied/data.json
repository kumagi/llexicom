As an adjective, it describes something that is not tied or has come loose. As a verb (past participle), it indicates the action of undoing a knot or fastening has been completed. Context is crucial to determine its function in a sentence.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ He was untied his shoes.","correct":"✓ He untied his shoes.","note":"When using 'untied' as the past simple tense, it doesn't require an auxiliary verb like 'was' unless forming a passive construction (e.g., 'His shoes were untied by him')."},{"incorrect":"✗ The shoelaces were untie.","correct":"✓ The shoelaces were untied.","note":"When using 'untied' as an adjective, it should match the tense of the sentence. If the shoelaces *are* in a state of being untied, use 'were untied' (past tense) or 'are untied' (present tense).

It's the opposite of 'tied'. You can use it to describe things like shoelaces that have come undone, or a rope that has been released. It's a fairly straightforward word to understand, but remember that it's often used to describe a state (something *is* untied) or a completed action (someone *untied* something)."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The boat drifted away after the mooring rope came **untied**.","translation":"係留ロープがほどけた後、ボートは漂流していった。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"ほどけた"},{"sentence":"She **untied** the package carefully to avoid damaging the contents.","translation":"彼女は中身を傷つけないように注意深く小包をほどいた。","type":"verb (past simple)","meaning_category":"ほどいた"},{"sentence":"With his hands **untied**, he was able to escape.","translation":"手がほどかれたことで、彼は逃げることができた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"解かれた"},{"sentence":"The dog ran around with its leash **untied**.","translation":"犬はリードがほどけたまま走り回っていた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"ほどけた"}]}

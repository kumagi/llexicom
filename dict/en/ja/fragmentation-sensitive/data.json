It describes something (like a file system or application) that performs poorly when data is stored in a fragmented way (i.e., not contiguously).  Outside of computing, it can describe something that breaks apart easily. The word itself is formed from 'fragmentation' (the process of breaking into pieces) and 'sensitive' (easily affected)."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"Due to its design, the database is highly fragmentation-sensitive.","translation":"設計上、このデータベースは断片化の影響を非常に受けやすい。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"computing"},{"sentence":"The old glass was extremely fragmentation-sensitive and shattered easily.","translation":"その古いガラスは非常に壊れやすく、簡単に粉々になった。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"general"}]}

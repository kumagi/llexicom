It is formed from \"out-\" and \"draught,\" indicating air moving outwards or inwards. While \"draught\" or \"draft\" are more commonly used in general English, \"outdraught\" specifies the nature of the airflow in a more particular way. Understanding this word requires familiarity with regional vocabulary and a good grasp of compound word formation."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The thick curtains helped to reduce the outdraught from the ill-fitting windows.","translation":"厚いカーテンは、隙間だらけの窓からの隙間風を減らすのに役立った。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"換気、通風、隙間風"},{"sentence":"He could feel the cold outdraught on his neck as he sat near the door.","translation":"彼はドアの近くに座ると、首に冷たい隙間風を感じた。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"換気、通風、隙間風"}]}

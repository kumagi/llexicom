It's a crucial component in refrigeration, air conditioning, and distillation processes. In refrigeration and air conditioning, the evaporator absorbs heat from the surrounding environment, cooling it down. In distillation, it's used to vaporize a component of a liquid mixture so that it can be separated from the other components.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"The evaporator condensates the refrigerant.","correct":"The evaporator evaporates the refrigerant.","note":"Evaporators are for evaporation, not condensation."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["evaporate","evaporation"],"related_terms":["condenser","compressor","expansion valve"],"priority":"★★★"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"B2","frequency_google_ngram":"Relatively low frequency.","priority":"★★☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"B2","text":"The word \"evaporator\" refers to a piece of equipment that turns a liquid into a gas.

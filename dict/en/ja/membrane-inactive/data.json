This can be important in drug design, where it may be desirable to have a compound that does not disrupt cell membranes. It is also used to describe proteins or other biomolecules that exist in a form that does not associate with membranes.","priority":"medium"},"level_frequency":{"frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency - specialized scientific term.","priority":"low"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Membrane-inactive' is a technical term used in scientific contexts, particularly in chemistry and biology. It describes a substance or molecule that does not interact with or affect biological membranes. Understanding this term requires a background in these fields. If a substance is described as 'membrane-inactive', it means it does not disrupt or otherwise affect the function of cell membranes. This is often a desirable property in drug development, as it reduces the risk of toxic side effects."}}],"etymology":{"value":"Formed by combining 'membrane' with 'inactive'.","priority":"low"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/ˈmɛmbreɪn ɪnˈæktɪv/","syllables":"mem-brane-in-ac-tive"},"inflection":{},"common_mistakes":{},"related_words":{"derivatives":["membrane","inactive","membrane-active"],"related_terms":["cell membrane","lipid bilayer","cytoplasm"]},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The newly synthesized peptide was found to be largely membrane-inactive.","translation":"新たに合成されたペプチドは、大部分が膜不活性であることが判明した。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"membrane interaction"}]}

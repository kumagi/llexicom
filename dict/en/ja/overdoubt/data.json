It is formed by adding the prefix 'over-' to the word 'doubt,' indicating an excess. While the meaning is generally clear from its construction, it is less frequently used than phrases like 'excessive doubt' or 'doubt too much.' It is more likely to be encountered in writing or discussions about psychology or decision-making, where the concept of excessive doubt is relevant. Using more common phrases might be preferable for clarity in general communication."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"She tends to **overdoubt** her decisions, leading to unnecessary anxiety.","translation":"彼女は自分の決断を疑いすぎる傾向があり、それが不必要な不安につながっている。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"過度に疑う"},{"sentence":"His **overdoubt** in his own abilities held him back from pursuing his dreams.","translation":"彼自身の能力に対する過度の疑念が、彼が夢を追求することを妨げた。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"過度の疑念"}]}

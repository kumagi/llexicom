It is the opposite of 'loxodromical', which refers to a path of constant bearing, also known as a rhumb line. A common example of a nonloxodromical route is a great circle route, which represents the shortest distance between two points on a sphere but requires continuous adjustments to the compass bearing.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The plane flew a nonloxodromic route.","correct":"✓ The plane flew a nonloxodromical route.","note":"Ensure the correct spelling of 'nonloxodromical' is used, particularly the ending '-ical'."}],"priority":"★☆☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["loxodrome","loxodromic","orthodrome","orthodromic"],"related_terms":["rhumb line","great circle","navigation","cartography"],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"level":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Very low frequency.

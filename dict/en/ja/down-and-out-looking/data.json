It is a compound adjective formed from the phrase 'down-and-out,' which itself refers to a person in a state of extreme poverty or misfortune. The addition of '-looking' transforms the phrase into an adjective that describes someone's outward appearance as resembling that state. This term is relatively uncommon and may be more frequently encountered in literature or descriptive writing. It is important to use this term sensitively, as it can perpetuate negative stereotypes about poverty and homelessness."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The artist painted a portrait of a down-and-out-looking man sitting in the rain.","translation":"その芸術家は、雨の中に座っている落ちぶれた様子の男の肖像画を描いた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"appearance"},{"sentence":"The detective noticed a down-and-out-looking woman searching through the trash cans.","translation":"刑事は、ゴミ箱を漁っている身なりがみすぼらしい女性に気づいた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"appearance"},{"sentence":"The charity provides food and shelter to down-and-out-looking individuals in the city.","translation":"その慈善団体は、市内の落ちぶれた様子の人々に食料と住居を提供している。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"appearance"}]}

It refers to the practice of loading data pages into memory before they are actually needed by a running process. This is done to reduce the delay caused by page faults, which occur when a process tries to access a page that is not currently in memory. Prepaging is a more advanced concept, and understanding it requires familiarity with operating system principles and memory management techniques."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The effectiveness of **prepaging** depends on the accuracy of the prediction algorithm.","translation":"プリページングの有効性は、予測アルゴリズムの精度に依存します。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"オペレーティングシステム技術"},{"sentence":"The system attempts to **prepage** frequently accessed data to reduce latency.","translation":"システムは、レイテンシを減らすために、頻繁にアクセスされるデータをプリページしようとします。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"オペレーティングシステム操作"}]}

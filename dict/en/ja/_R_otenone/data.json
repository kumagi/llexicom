It is primarily used as a broad-spectrum insecticide, piscicide (fish poison), and pesticide. Its mechanism of action involves disrupting the electron transport chain in mitochondria, leading to cellular energy deprivation and ultimately death in susceptible organisms. The use of rotenone is controversial due to its potential non-selective toxicity, affecting not only target species but also other aquatic organisms and potentially posing risks to human health through exposure.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Rotenone is a safe pesticide for all animals.","correct":"✓ Rotenone can be toxic to some animals, including fish and mammals.","note":"Rotenone is not safe for all animals and can be toxic to fish and mammals.

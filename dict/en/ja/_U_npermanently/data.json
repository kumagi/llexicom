It is formed by adding the prefix 'un-' to the adverb 'permanently.' Due to its infrequent use, it is more common to use synonyms like 'temporarily' or 'transiently' to convey the same meaning. It is best suited for formal or technical contexts where precision is required, but in most everyday situations, alternative words are preferred."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The exhibit was unpermanently installed, allowing for easy removal after the festival.","translation":"展示物は一時的に設置され、フェスティバル終了後に簡単に撤去できるようになっていました。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"temporary installation"},{"sentence":"The changes to the website were unpermanently implemented for testing purposes.","translation":"ウェブサイトへの変更は、テスト目的で一時的に実装されました。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"temporary implementation"}]}

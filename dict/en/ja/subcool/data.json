It refers to the process of cooling a liquid refrigerant below its saturation temperature at a given pressure.

The amount of subcooling is measured in degrees (e.g., degrees Celsius or Fahrenheit) and is an important indicator of system performance.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The system is supercooled.","correct":"✓ The system is subcooled.","note":"\"Supercooled\" refers to cooling a liquid below its freezing point without it solidifying, which is a different concept from subcooling in refrigeration.

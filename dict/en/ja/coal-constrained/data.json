This limitation can be due to various factors, such as environmental regulations aimed at reducing carbon emissions, the scarcity of coal resources, or the adoption of alternative energy sources. The term is commonly found in discussions related to energy policy, climate change, and sustainable development. Understanding this term requires familiarity with the broader context of global efforts to transition away from fossil fuels.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The government implemented a coal-constrained policy to reduce air pollution.","translation":"政府は大気汚染を減らすために石炭利用を制限する政策を実施した。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"石炭利用制限"},{"sentence":"The company is investing in renewable energy to adapt to a coal-constrained market.","translation":"その企業は、石炭利用が制限された市場に適応するために再生可能エネルギーに投資している。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"石炭利用制限"},{"sentence":"The transition to a coal-constrained economy presents both challenges and opportunities.","translation":"石炭利用が制限された経済への移行は、課題と機会の両方をもたらす。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"石炭利用制限"}]}

It typically consists of a rotating element (like a propeller or vane) that is turned by the water current, and a mechanism to measure the rate of rotation, which is then converted into a flow velocity.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[],"priority":"☆☆☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["hydrometry","tachymeter"],"related_terms":["hydrology","fluid mechanics"]},"level_frequency":{"frequency_google_ngram":"Very low frequency.","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"The term \"hydrotachymeter\" refers to a specialized instrument used to measure water flow velocity.

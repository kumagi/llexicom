The first, and perhaps more common, is to describe something as being **absolute, unconditional, or without exception**. This is often used in the context of denials, statements, or proofs. The second sense relates to **categories or classification**, often in a scientific or academic context. It's important to understand the context to determine which meaning is intended.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ He gave a categorical yes to the proposal.","correct":"✓ He gave a definite yes to the proposal. / ✓ He categorically agreed to the proposal.","note":"While \"categorical\" can imply a strong affirmation, it's more commonly used with negations or denials.

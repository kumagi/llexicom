It has two main meanings, both of which are rarely used today. The first meaning is 'capable of being attacked,' and the second is 'apt to cause offense.' In modern English, 'offensive' is used to describe something that causes offense, and 'vulnerable' or 'attackable' are used to describe something that can be easily attacked. Because 'offensible' is not commonly used, it is best to avoid it in favor of more current and precise language."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The town, being poorly fortified, was easily offensible to the enemy.","translation":"その町は、防御が不十分であったため、敵にとって容易に攻撃可能であった。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"攻撃可能な"},{"sentence":"He found her remarks extremely offensible, though she meant no harm.","translation":"彼女は悪意はなかったものの、彼は彼女の発言を非常に不快に感じた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"感情を害しやすい"}]}

It is formed by adding the prefix \"non-\" (meaning \"not\") to \"epicurean.\" To understand \"nonepicurean,\" one must first understand \"epicurean,\" which refers to a person devoted to refined sensuous enjoyment, especially good food and drink, or relating to the philosophical system of Epicurus, which emphasized maximizing pleasure and minimizing pain. Therefore, \"nonepicurean\" describes someone or something that is not characterized by these qualities. It is often used to describe a lifestyle or philosophy that emphasizes simplicity, abstinence, or self-denial, in contrast to the pursuit of pleasure and luxury. This word is most likely to be encountered in philosophical, historical, or literary contexts."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The hermit's nonepicurean diet consisted mainly of roots and berries.","translation":"その隠者の禁欲的な食事は、主に根とベリーで構成されていた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"快楽主義的でない"},{"sentence":"She chose a nonepicurean path, dedicating her life to helping the poor.","translation":"彼女は快楽を求めない道を選び、貧しい人々を助けることに人生を捧げた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"快楽主義的でない"},{"sentence":"He was a nonepicurean, finding satisfaction in simple acts of kindness.","translation":"彼は快楽主義者ではなく、ささやかな親切な行為に満足を見出していた。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"快楽主義者でない人"}]}

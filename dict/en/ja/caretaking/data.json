'Care' comes from Old English 'caru', meaning sorrow, anxiety, or trouble, which evolved to mean attention, heed, or concern. The suffix '-taking' implies the act or process of taking or performing something. Therefore, 'caretaking' literally means the act of taking care.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"ˈkeəˌteɪkɪŋ/","syllables":"care-tak-ing"},"inflection":{"noun_plural":"caretakings"},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Caretaking' generally refers to the act of providing care and support to someone who needs assistance, often due to age, illness, or disability.

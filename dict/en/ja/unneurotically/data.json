'Neurotically' is derived from 'neurotic', which comes from 'neurosis', a term originally used in medicine to describe mental disorders involving distress but not delusions or hallucinations. The suffix '-ally' turns 'neurotic' into an adverb. Therefore, 'unneurotically' means 'not in a neurotic manner'.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/ˌʌn.njʊˈrɒtɪkli/","syllables":"un-neu-rot-i-cal-ly"},"inflection":{"notes":"Adverbs do not inflect."},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Unneurotically' describes actions or behaviors that are free from excessive anxiety, obsession, or irrationality.

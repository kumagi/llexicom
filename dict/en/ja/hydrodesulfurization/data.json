It involves the removal of sulfur compounds from petroleum fractions by reacting them with hydrogen in the presence of a catalyst. This process is necessary to meet environmental regulations and to prevent the poisoning of catalysts used in downstream processes. The sulfur is converted to hydrogen sulfide (H₂S), which is then removed and converted to elemental sulfur.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ hydro-desulfurization","correct":"✓ hydrodesulfurization","note":"The term is usually written as one word, without a hyphen."},{"incorrect":"✗ hydrodesulphurization","correct":"✓ hydrodesulfurization","note":"The American English spelling is 'sulfur,' while the British English spelling is 'sulphur.'

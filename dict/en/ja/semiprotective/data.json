It is formed by combining the prefix 'semi-' (meaning 'half' or 'partially') with the adjective 'protective'. The word is typically used in technical or specialized contexts where the degree of protection is important to specify. For example, a 'semiprotective coating' might offer some resistance to scratches or corrosion, but not complete immunity. Understanding the meaning of the prefix 'semi-' is essential to grasping the meaning of this word."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The semiprotective film on the screen prevents minor scratches.","translation":"画面の準保護フィルムは、小さな傷を防ぎます。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"protection"},{"sentence":"The soldiers wore semiprotective armor during training exercises.","translation":"兵士たちは訓練演習中に準保護装甲を着用した。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"protection"},{"sentence":"The semiprotective case for the phone offers limited shock absorption.","translation":"電話用の準保護ケースは、衝撃吸収を限定的に提供する。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"protection"}]}

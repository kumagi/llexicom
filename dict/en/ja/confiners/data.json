'Confine' comes from the Old French word 'confiner,' meaning 'to border on, be adjacent to,' and from Latin 'confinare,' meaning 'to limit, bound,' from 'confinis,' meaning 'bordering, adjacent,' from 'con-' (together) + 'finis' (end, limit).","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/kənˈfaɪnərz/","syllables":"con-fin-ers"},"inflection":{"noun_plural":"confiners"},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Confiners' refers to multiple entities (people, things, or circumstances) that impose limitations or boundaries.

It refers to entities that restrict or limit something. Understanding the word requires a grasp of the verb 'confine' and the ability to recognize the agent noun formed by adding '-er' to the verb stem. The plural form 'confiners' indicates multiple entities performing this restrictive action. Due to its infrequent use, it is more likely encountered in advanced reading materials.

It is formed by adding the prefix 'un-' to 'transmittably,' indicating negation. The word is rarely used in everyday conversation and is more likely to appear in academic or technical contexts where precise language is necessary to convey the impossibility of conveying something. Understanding the root word 'transmit' and the negative prefix 'un-' is helpful in deciphering its meaning."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The nuances of the poem were untransmittably lost in translation.","translation":"その詩のニュアンスは、翻訳では伝達不可能なほど失われていた。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"伝達不可能に"},{"sentence":"The trauma left him untransmittably scarred.","translation":"そのトラウマは彼に、伝達不可能なほど深い傷跡を残した。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"伝達不可能に"}]}

It refers either to the octane molecules present in the fuel or, more commonly, to the octane rating, which indicates the fuel's ability to resist engine knocking. The higher the octane rating, the more resistant the fuel is to pre-ignition or knocking.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The car needs a high octane.","correct":"✓ The car needs high octanes. / ✓ The car needs high-octane fuel.","note":"'Octane' is a mass noun when referring to the substance itself, but 'octanes' (plural) is often used when referring to the octane rating or different types of octane molecules.

In geology and engineering, it refers to reducing the pressure on soil or sediment, making it less dense. In computer science, it refers to the process of uncompressing data, restoring it to its original form. The word is formed by adding the prefix 'de-' (meaning 'removal' or 'reversal') to 'compaction'.

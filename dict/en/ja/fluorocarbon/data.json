They are known for their stability and non-reactivity. However, some fluorocarbons, such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), have been found to deplete the ozone layer, leading to restrictions on their production and use. Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) are now often used as replacements, although they are still potent greenhouse gases.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Fluorocarbon is a element.","correct":"✓ Fluorocarbon is a compound.","note":"Fluorocarbon is a chemical compound, not an element."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["fluorination","fluoride"],"phrasal_verbs":[]},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C1","frequency_google_ngram":"Relatively low frequency.","priority":"★★☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"The term 'fluorocarbon' refers to a complex chemical compound made of carbon and fluorine.

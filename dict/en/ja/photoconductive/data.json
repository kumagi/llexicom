This happens because light particles (photons) give energy to electrons in the material, allowing them to move more freely and carry electrical current. The related term \"photoconductivity\" is the name for this property. These terms are mainly used in physics, electrical engineering, and materials science.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The camera's sensor uses a **photoconductive** material to capture images.","translation":"カメラのセンサーは、画像を取り込むために光伝導性材料を使用しています。","type":"general","meaning_category":"general"},{"sentence":"The **photoconductive** cell's resistance decreases when exposed to light.","translation":"光伝導セルの抵抗は、光にさらされると減少します。","type":"technical","meaning_category":"technical"},{"sentence":"Researchers are exploring new **photoconductive** polymers for solar energy applications.","translation":"研究者たちは、太陽エネルギー用途向けの新しい光伝導性ポリマーを研究しています。","type":"research","meaning_category":"research"}]}

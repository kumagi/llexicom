Inertia is the tendency of an object to resist changes in its state of motion. Therefore, when something moves noninertly, it means that its motion changes readily in response to applied forces, without significant resistance due to its mass or other inertial properties. This term is often used in physics and engineering contexts.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The object moved in a non-inert way.","correct":"✓ The object moved noninertly.","note":"Using the adverb 'noninertly' is more concise and precise than using the phrase 'in a non-inert way'."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["noninertial (adjective)","inertia (noun)","inert (adjective)","inertly (adverb)"],"related_terms":["frame of reference","acceleration","force","mass"],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Very low frequency","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C2","text":"The word 'noninertly' is a specialized term primarily used in physics and engineering.

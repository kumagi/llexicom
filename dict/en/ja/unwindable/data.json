It can be used in a literal sense to describe something that cannot be unwound, such as a tightly knotted rope or a mechanism designed not to be unwound. It can also be used figuratively to describe a state of tension or stress that is difficult to relieve.

It combines 'unwind' (to undo something that is wound or to relax) with '-able' (meaning capable of). Therefore, 'unwindable' means 'not capable of being unwound' or 'not capable of being relaxed'. It can be used literally to describe physical objects or figuratively to describe a state of tension. Because of its relative rarity, it's best to use it in contexts where the meaning is clear, or to choose more common alternatives like 'irreversible' or 'tense'."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The knot was so tight that the rope was completely unwindable.","translation":"結び目が非常にきつく、ロープは完全にほどけなかった。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"巻き戻し可能でない"},{"sentence":"The spring mechanism was designed to be unwindable to prevent tampering.","translation":"バネの機構は、不正操作を防ぐために巻き戻せないように設計されていた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"巻き戻し可能でない"},{"sentence":"After the stressful meeting, she felt completely unwindable and couldn't relax.","translation":"ストレスの多い会議の後、彼女は完全にリラックスできず、緊張が解けなかった。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"リラックスできない"}]}

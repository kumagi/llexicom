This means they do not believe in God as three co-equal persons (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit). Instead, they typically affirm the oneness of God – hence 'Uni-' meaning 'one.' Historically, Unitarians emphasized reason and individual conscience over dogma, leading to a more liberal interpretation of religious beliefs.  The term can also describe churches or denominations that hold these beliefs."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"As a lifelong **Unitarian**, she valued freedom of thought above all else.","translation":"生涯のユニタリアンとして、彼女は何よりも自由な思考を大切にしていた。","type":"noun, describing a person's belief system","meaning_category":"人 (信仰体系)"},{"sentence":"The **Unitarian** Church welcomed people from all backgrounds and faiths.","translation":"ユニタリアン教会は、あらゆる背景や信仰を持つ人々を歓迎した。","type":"adjective, describing a church","meaning_category":"教会 (名称)"},{"sentence":"Many **Unitarians** advocate for social justice and environmental activism.","translation":"多くのユニタリアンは、社会正義と環境活動を提唱している。","type":"noun, plural, referring to followers","meaning_category":"信者 (複数形)"},{"sentence":"The historical roots of **Unitarianism** can be traced back to the Reformation.","translation":"ユニタリアニズムの歴史的ルーツは宗教改革に遡る。","type":"noun, referring to the theological system","meaning_category":"神学体系 (名称)"}]}

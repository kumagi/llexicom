'Interoperably' is derived from 'interoperable', which combines 'inter-' (meaning 'between' or 'among') and 'operable' (meaning 'able to operate'). Thus, 'non-interoperably' means 'not able to operate together'.","priority":"★☆☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/ˌnɒnɪnˈtɒpərəbli/","syllables":"non-in-top-er-a-bly"},"inflection":{"notes":"Adverbs do not typically inflect."},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Non-interoperably' describes a situation where systems, devices, or software are intentionally or unintentionally unable to work together.

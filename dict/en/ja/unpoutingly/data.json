It is formed by adding the prefix 'un-' (meaning 'not') and the suffix '-ly' (forming an adverb) to the word 'pouting'. To understand 'unpoutingly', one must first understand 'pouting', which refers to the action of sticking out one's lips to express displeasure or sulkiness. Therefore, 'unpoutingly' means 'without displaying such displeasure or sulkiness'. Its use implies a level of emotional maturity or a conscious effort to avoid expressing negative feelings. Due to its rarity and complexity, it is more likely to be encountered in advanced texts or sophisticated writing.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"Despite the disappointing news, she accepted it unpoutingly and began to plan a new strategy.","translation":"残念な知らせにもかかわらず、彼女はふくれっ面をせずにそれを受け入れ、新しい戦略を立て始めた。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"without pouting"},{"sentence":"He agreed to help with the chores unpoutingly, surprising his parents.","translation":"彼はふくれっ面をせずに家事の手伝いに同意し、両親を驚かせた。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"without pouting"}]}

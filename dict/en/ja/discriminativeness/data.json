'Discriminate' originates from the Latin 'discriminare,' meaning 'to divide, separate, distinguish,' which in turn comes from 'discrimen,' meaning 'distinction, difference.' The suffix '-ness' is added to 'discriminative' to form the noun, indicating the quality or state of being discriminative.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/dɪˈskrɪmɪnətɪvnəs/","syllables":"dis-crim-i-na-tive-ness"},"inflection":{"noun_plural":"discriminativenesses (rarely used, typically used as an uncountable noun)"},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Discriminativeness' refers to the ability to make fine distinctions or the degree to which something allows for such distinctions. It is often used in contexts involving testing, algorithms, sensory perception, or any situation where the ability to differentiate between similar items is important.

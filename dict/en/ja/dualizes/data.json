It refers to the process of forming the dual of a mathematical object, such as a vector space or a module. The dual object often has properties that are in some sense 'opposite' or 'complementary' to the original object.","priority":"N/A"},"common_mistakes":{},"related_words":{"derivatives":["dual","duality","dualizing","dualizable"],"related_terms":["adjoint","functor","homomorphism","isomorphism","vector space"]},"level_frequency":{},"readability_explanation":{"level":"Advanced","text":"The term 'dualizes' is highly technical and specific to advanced mathematics.

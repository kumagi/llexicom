Normalization, in database terms, refers to organizing data to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.

It is often employed in data warehousing and OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) systems where complex queries and reporting are common.

It refers to a technique where you intentionally add redundancy (duplication) to a database that was previously 'normalized' (organized to reduce redundancy). The main reason for doing this is to make it faster to retrieve data, especially for complex reports or analyses. However, it's a trade-off, as it can make updating the data more complicated and increase the risk of inconsistencies. It's a more advanced concept typically discussed in database administration and data warehousing contexts."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The data warehouse uses a heavily denormalized schema to support fast analytical queries.","translation":"データウェアハウスは、高速な分析クエリをサポートするために、高度に非正規化されたスキーマを使用しています。","type":"general","meaning_category":"database"},{"sentence":"We decided to denormalize the product and category tables to avoid expensive join operations.","translation":"高コストな結合操作を避けるために、製品テーブルとカテゴリテーブルを非正規化することにしました。","type":"technical","meaning_category":"database"},{"sentence":"Denormalization is a common practice in OLAP systems.","translation":"非正規化はOLAPシステムでは一般的な手法です。","type":"technical","meaning_category":"database"}]}

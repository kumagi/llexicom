It's commonly associated with verbs of perception (see, hear, feel), emotion (love, hate, fear), and cognition (know, understand, believe). The experiencer is not performing an action (that would be an agent), nor is it being directly affected by an action (that would be a patient). Instead, it is the entity that is having an experience.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"The hammer is the experiencer in 'The hammer broke the window'.","correct":"The hammer is the instrument in 'The hammer broke the window'.","note":"The hammer is the *instrument* because it's used to perform the action.

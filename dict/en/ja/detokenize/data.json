It refers to the process of taking a sequence of tokens (individual words or sub-word units) and reconstructing them into a coherent and readable text string. This is often necessary after performing operations like stemming, lemmatization, or other text transformations. The goal is to reverse the tokenization process while maintaining readability and grammatical correctness.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ I need to untoken the text.","correct":"✓ I need to detokenize the text.","note":"While \"untokenize\" might seem like a logical alternative, \"detokenize\" is the more commonly accepted and used term in the field of NLP."},{"incorrect":"✗ The detokenization is very difficultly.","correct":"✓ The detokenization is very difficult.","note":"\"Difficult\" is an adjective, so it should be used instead of the adverb \"difficultly\"."}],"priority":"★☆☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["detokenization"],"related":["tokenize","token","tokenization","natural language processing","NLP"],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"N/A","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency - Primarily used in technical contexts.","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"\"Detokenize\" means to put words back together after they've been split up into smaller pieces (tokens) by a computer program.

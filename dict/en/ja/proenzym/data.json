It refers to the inactive form of an enzyme. Think of it as an enzyme waiting to be 'switched on.' It's like a seed that needs water to grow into a plant. Without activation, the proenzym remains dormant. This concept is important because it prevents enzymes from causing damage in the wrong place or at the wrong time.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"Pepsinogen is a **proenzym** secreted by the chief cells in the stomach.","translation":"ペプシノーゲンは胃の主細胞から分泌されるプロエンザイムである。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"生化学"},{"sentence":"The activation of the **proenzym** cascade is crucial for blood coagulation.","translation":"プロエンザイムカスケードの活性化は血液凝固に不可欠である。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"生化学"}]}

It's a compound word that combines 'conspicuously' (easily noticed) and 'haired' (having hair). This term is not commonly used in everyday conversation but is more likely to appear in descriptive writing where the author wants to emphasize a person's striking hair. Understanding this term requires a good grasp of both the individual words and how they combine to form a more complex adjective."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The artist painted a portrait of a conspicuously-haired woman with fiery red locks.","translation":"その芸術家は燃えるような赤い髪をした、人目を引く髪の女性の肖像画を描いた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"descriptive"}]}

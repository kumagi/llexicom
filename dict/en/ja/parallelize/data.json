'Parallel' comes from the Greek 'parallelos', meaning 'side by side'. Thus, 'parallelize' means 'to make parallel' or 'to arrange in a parallel fashion', specifically in the context of computing processes.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"ˈpærəˌlaɪz","syllables":"par-al-lel-ize"},"inflection":{"verb_forms":{"present_simple":["parallelize","parallelizes"],"past_simple":"parallelized","past_participle":"parallelized","present_participle":"parallelizing"}},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Parallelize' is a technical term primarily used in computer science and engineering. It refers to the process of restructuring a sequential process or program so that it can be executed in parallel, typically to improve performance and reduce execution time. This often involves dividing the task into smaller subtasks that can be processed simultaneously on multiple processors or cores. The term is commonly used in discussions of high-performance computing, distributed systems, and software optimization.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ I'm going to parallel the tasks.","correct":"✓ I'm going to parallelize the tasks.","note":"While 'parallel' can be used as a verb, 'parallelize' is more specific and common when referring to making a process parallel in computing.

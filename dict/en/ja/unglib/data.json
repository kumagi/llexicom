It is best understood in contrast to its root word, 'glib,' which describes someone who speaks easily and smoothly, often in a way that is insincere or superficial.

Due to its rarity, it is more likely to be encountered in advanced literary contexts or specialized discussions about communication styles."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The witness's unglib testimony convinced the jury of her sincerity.","translation":"証人のぎこちない証言は、陪審員に彼女の誠実さを確信させた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"Lacking glibness"},{"sentence":"His unglib manner made it clear he was uncomfortable with public speaking.","translation":"彼のぎこちない態度は、彼が人前で話すのが苦手であることを明らかにした。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"Lacking glibness"}]}

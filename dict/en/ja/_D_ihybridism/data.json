It's a more complex version of monohybridism, which only looks at one trait. Understanding dihybridism helps scientists predict how different characteristics will be passed down from parents to offspring. It's based on Mendel's laws, especially the idea that different genes are inherited independently of each other.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The dihybridism observed in pea plants helped Mendel formulate his laws of inheritance.","translation":"エンドウ豆の植物で観察された二重雑種性は、メンデルが彼の遺伝の法則を策定するのに役立った。","type":"scientific","meaning_category":"genetics"},{"sentence":"The phenotypic ratio of 9:3:3:1 is a hallmark of dihybridism in the F2 generation.","translation":"9:3:3:1の表現型比は、F2世代における二重雑種性の特徴である。","type":"scientific","meaning_category":"genetics"}]}

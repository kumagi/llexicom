It refers to the condition where an organism has multiple sets of chromosomes derived from different species. This is a relatively rare phenomenon, but it is important in the evolution of some plant species. Understanding this term requires knowledge of basic genetics and evolutionary concepts."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The formation of new allopolyploid species can occur relatively rapidly in evolutionary terms.","translation":"新しい異質倍数性種の形成は、進化の観点から比較的急速に起こりうる。","type":"general","meaning_category":"General"},{"sentence":"Genetic analysis confirmed that the cultivated banana is not an allopolyploid.","translation":"遺伝子解析により、栽培バナナは異質倍数性ではないことが確認された。","type":"specific","meaning_category":"Specific"}]}

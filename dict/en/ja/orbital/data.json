As an adjective, it describes something related to an orbit (the path of an object around another in space) or to the eye socket (the bony cavity containing the eye). As a noun (more common in scientific contexts), it refers to the specific mathematical function describing the probability of finding an electron in a particular region around an atom's nucleus.

In general contexts, it describes something related to an orbit, like the path a satellite takes around a planet. In science, especially chemistry and physics, 'orbital' refers to a mathematical description of where an electron is likely to be found around an atom. This scientific meaning is more technical and requires understanding of quantum mechanics.

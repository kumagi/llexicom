It describes bacteria that do not produce spores. Spores are highly resistant structures that allow bacteria to survive harsh conditions. Therefore, nonsporeforming bacteria are generally easier to kill with heat or disinfectants than sporeforming bacteria. This term is important in fields like medicine, food safety, and environmental science."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"Most of the bacteria on our skin are nonsporeforming.","translation":"私たちの皮膚上の細菌のほとんどは芽胞を形成しません。","type":"general","meaning_category":"general"},{"sentence":"The effectiveness of the disinfectant was tested against both sporeforming and nonsporeforming organisms.","translation":"消毒剤の有効性は、芽胞形成生物と非芽胞形成生物の両方に対してテストされました。","type":"scientific","meaning_category":"scientific"}]}

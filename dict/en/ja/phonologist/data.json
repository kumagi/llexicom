Phonology is a branch of linguistics that focuses on the systematic organization of sounds in languages. This includes how sounds are categorized, how they interact with each other, and the rules that govern their use. Phonologists aim to understand the underlying patterns and structures of sound systems, rather than just the physical properties of individual sounds (which is the domain of phonetics). The term is typically used in academic or research contexts.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The **phonologist** presented her research on vowel harmony at the conference.","translation":"その音韻論者は、会議で母音調和に関する研究発表を行った。","type":"general","meaning_category":"音韻論者"},{"sentence":"As a **phonologist**, he specializes in the sound systems of endangered languages.","translation":"音韻論者として、彼は絶滅危惧言語の音組織を専門としている。","type":"specialized","meaning_category":"音韻論者"}]}

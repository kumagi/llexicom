It means that an action or offense cannot be punished, either because it is not considered a crime, there is a lack of evidence, or the person is immune from punishment. It is more formal and less frequently used than 'unpunished,' which simply means that an action has not been punished. Understanding the distinction between 'unpunishable' and 'unpunished' is key to using the word correctly."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The judge ruled that the defendant's actions were technically illegal but ultimately unpunishable.","translation":"裁判官は、被告の行為は技術的には違法だが、最終的には処罰できないと判断した。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"処罰できない"},{"sentence":"Due to diplomatic immunity, certain offenses committed by diplomats are unpunishable in the host country.","translation":"外交特権により、外交官が犯した特定の犯罪は、受け入れ国では処罰されない。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"処罰できない"},{"sentence":"Many believe that thought crimes should remain unpunishable, even if they are offensive.","translation":"多くの人は、たとえ不快であっても、思想犯は処罰されるべきではないと考えている。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"処罰できない"}]}

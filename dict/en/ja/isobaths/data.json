They help show the underwater shape of a body of water, like the ocean or a lake. If the lines are close together, it means the depth changes quickly, like a steep slope. If they are far apart, the depth changes slowly. This term is mostly used by people who study the ocean or make maps for ships."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The divers used the isobaths to navigate the underwater canyon.","translation":"ダイバーたちは等深線を使って、水中の峡谷を航行した。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"cartography"},{"sentence":"The isobaths revealed a previously unknown underwater mountain range.","translation":"等深線は、これまで知られていなかった水中の山脈を明らかにした。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"oceanography"}]}

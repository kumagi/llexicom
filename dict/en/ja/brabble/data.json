It describes a noisy and often petty argument or quarrel, usually about trivial matters. It is more likely to be encountered in older literature or specialized contexts.

It's important to remember that it implies a less serious and more trivial form of disagreement than words like 'argument' or 'dispute'."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The two politicians brabbled endlessly about the minor details of the bill.","translation":"その二人の政治家は法案の些細な詳細について延々と口論した。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"口論する"},{"sentence":"Their brabble over the parking space escalated into a shouting match.","translation":"彼らの駐車スペースをめぐる口論は、怒鳴り合いに発展した。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"口論"},{"sentence":"I could hear the children brabbling in the next room.","translation":"隣の部屋で子供たちが騒々しく言い争っているのが聞こえた。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"騒々しく議論する"}]}

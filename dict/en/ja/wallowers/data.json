This can be literal, such as animals wallowing in mud, or figurative, such as people wallowing in self-pity. The term often carries a negative connotation when used figuratively, implying a lack of self-control or a refusal to move on from a negative state. Understanding the nuances requires a relatively advanced vocabulary and comprehension of figurative language."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The children were gleeful wallowers in the ball pit.","translation":"子供たちはボールプールの中で喜んで転げ回っていた。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"泥や水の中で転げ回る人"},{"sentence":"She accused him of being one of the wallowers in nostalgia, unable to move forward.","translation":"彼女は彼が過去の思い出に浸り、前に進むことができない人だと非難した。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"快楽などに浸る人"}]}

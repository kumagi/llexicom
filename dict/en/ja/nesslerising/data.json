It refers to the process of adding Nessler's reagent to a sample to detect the presence of ammonia. The reagent reacts with ammonia to form a yellow-brown precipitate, the intensity of which is proportional to the ammonia concentration.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{},"related_words":{"derivatives":["Nessler's reagent (ネスラー試薬)","Nesslerisation (ネスラー化)"],"related_terms":["ammonia","reagent","chemistry","test","analysis"]},"level_frequency":{},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C2","text":"'Nesslerising' is a highly specialized term used in chemistry.

It is commonly used in steam power plants, steam locomotives, and other applications where high-temperature steam is required for efficient operation. The superheater heats the steam above its boiling point at a given pressure, resulting in superheated steam, which has a higher energy content and is more efficient for use in turbines and other machinery.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The superheater superheats the water.","correct":"✓ The superheater superheats the steam.","note":"Superheaters are used to heat steam, not water.

This process is crucial in applications requiring high-purity water, such as in laboratories, electronics manufacturing, and pharmaceuticals. Deionization differs from simple filtration, which removes particles, and distillation, which involves boiling and condensation. Instead, it employs ion exchange resins that attract and bind to ions, effectively removing them from the water. Understanding this term is important in contexts involving water treatment and chemical processes where ion-free water is essential."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The laboratory uses a **deionization** system to produce ultrapure water for experiments.","translation":"その研究所では、実験用の超純水を製造するために脱イオン化システムを使用している。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"イオン除去"},{"sentence":"**Deionization** is a critical step in the manufacturing of semiconductors.","translation":"脱イオン化は、半導体の製造における重要なステップである。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"イオン除去"},{"sentence":"The efficiency of the **deionization** process depends on the type and quality of the resin used.","translation":"脱イオン化プロセスの効率は、使用される樹脂の種類と品質に依存する。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"イオン除去"}]}

A catalyst is a substance that speeds up a chemical reaction without being consumed in the reaction itself. Therefore, a non-catalyzed reaction relies on other factors, such as temperature or concentration, to proceed.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{},"related_words":{"derivatives":["catalysis (名詞: 触媒作用)","catalyst (名詞: 触媒)","catalytic (形容詞: 触媒の、触媒作用のある)","catalyzed (形容詞: 触媒作用を受けた)"],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Non-catalyzed' is a technical term used in chemistry to describe a reaction that happens without a catalyst. A catalyst is something that helps a reaction go faster.

The bark is harvested, soaked, and then beaten with mallets to flatten and widen it into a usable cloth. It's a non-woven material, meaning it's not made by spinning fibers into yarn and then weaving them. Barkcloth has been used for centuries in various cultures, particularly in Africa, Oceania, and parts of Asia, for clothing, bedding, ceremonial purposes, and other applications. Today, it's also used in contemporary art, design, and fashion.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The barkcloth is weave.","correct":"✓ The barkcloth is nonwoven.","note":"Barkcloth is a nonwoven fabric, so it is not woven."},{"incorrect":"✗ Barkcloth made from cotton.","correct":"✓ Barkcloth made from tree bark.","note":"Barkcloth is made from the inner bark of trees, not cotton."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":[],"phrasal_verbs":[],"related_terms":["tapa","nonwoven fabric","textile","fiber"],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"N/A","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Barkcloth' refers to a specific type of fabric made from tree bark.

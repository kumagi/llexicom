This is the case for humans and many other animals. Understanding this term requires some background knowledge of genetics and life cycles. It's often contrasted with 'haplont', which describes organisms that spend most of their life cycle in the haploid phase (one set of chromosomes)."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"Most animals, including humans, are **diplonts**.","translation":"人間を含むほとんどの動物は**複相世代の生物**です。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"複相世代の生物"},{"sentence":"The **diplontic** life cycle is common in animals.","translation":"**複相世代の**生活環は動物によく見られます。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"複相世代の"}]}

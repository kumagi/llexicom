'Bypass' itself is a compound word consisting of 'by-' (meaning 'to the side of' or 'secondary') and 'pass' (meaning 'to go past'). The suffix '-able' indicates the capability or possibility of being acted upon. Therefore, 'by-passable' literally means 'able to be passed by' or 'able to be avoided'.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/baɪˈpæsəbəl/","syllables":"by-pass-a-ble"},"inflection":{"notes":"This is an adjective, so it can be modified by adverbs (e.g., easily by-passable) and can be used in comparative and superlative forms (more by-passable, most by-passable), though these are less common."},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'By-passable' is a relatively uncommon word, primarily used in technical or formal contexts.

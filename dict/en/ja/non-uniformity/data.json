It can describe variations in physical properties, distributions, or any other characteristic that is expected to be consistent.

It is frequently encountered in scientific, technical, and academic contexts. To understand it, remember that \"uniformity\" means that something is the same throughout. Therefore, \"non-uniformity\" indicates that there are differences or variations present. For example, in a material, non-uniformity might refer to variations in density or composition. In a distribution, it might refer to uneven spread or allocation.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The **non-uniformity** of the lighting across the stage created dramatic shadows.","translation":"ステージ全体の照明の不均一性が劇的な影を作り出した。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"general"},{"sentence":"Researchers are studying the effects of **non-uniformity** in the distribution of cosmic microwave background radiation.","translation":"研究者たちは、宇宙マイクロ波背景放射の分布における不均一性の影響を研究している。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"scientific"},{"sentence":"The **non-uniformity** of the paint application resulted in a patchy finish.","translation":"塗料の塗布の不均一性が、まだら模様の仕上がりをもたらした。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"practical application"},{"sentence":"The **non-uniformity** in the soil composition affected the growth of the plants.","translation":"土壌組成の不均一性が植物の成長に影響を与えた。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"environmental"}]}

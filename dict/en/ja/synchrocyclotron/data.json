It addresses the limitation of the classical cyclotron, which cannot effectively accelerate particles to relativistic speeds (close to the speed of light). The key difference is that the synchrocyclotron varies the frequency of the accelerating electric field to maintain synchronicity with the particles as they gain mass due to relativistic effects. Synchrocyclotrons are used in physics research and medical applications, such as proton therapy.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ synchro-cyclotron","correct":"✓ synchrocyclotron","note":"The correct spelling is without a hyphen."}],"priority":"★☆☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["cyclotron","synchrotron","particle accelerator"],"related_terms":["isochronous cyclotron","betatron"],"priority":"★☆☆"},"level_frequency":{"frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency.

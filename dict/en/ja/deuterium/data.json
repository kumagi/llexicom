It's twice as heavy as ordinary hydrogen (protium) because it has a neutron in addition to a proton in its nucleus. Deuterium is often represented by the symbol D or ²H. It's used in various scientific applications, including nuclear fusion, as a tracer in chemical reactions, and in the production of heavy water.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Deuterium is a radioactive element.","correct":"✓ Deuterium is a stable isotope.","note":"Deuterium is stable, not radioactive."},{"incorrect":"✗ Deuterium has two protons.","correct":"✓ Deuterium has one proton and one neutron.","note":"Deuterium has one proton and one neutron in its nucleus."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["deuterated (adjective)"],"related_terms":["isotope","hydrogen","protium","tritium","heavy water"],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency, primarily used in scientific contexts.","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"Deuterium is a scientific term referring to a specific isotope of hydrogen.

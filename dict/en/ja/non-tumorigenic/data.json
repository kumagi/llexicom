It describes something that does not cause tumors. Understanding this term requires a background in cell biology and an understanding of how tumors form. The prefix 'non-' indicates negation, and 'tumorigenic' refers to the ability to cause tumors. Therefore, 'non-tumorigenic' simply means 'not capable of causing tumors.'"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The researchers aimed to develop a non-tumorigenic vaccine.","translation":"研究者らは非腫瘍形成性のワクチンを開発することを目指した。","type":"general","meaning_category":"Medical Research"},{"sentence":"The control group consisted of non-tumorigenic human cells.","translation":"対照群は非腫瘍形成性のヒト細胞で構成されていた。","type":"general","meaning_category":"Cell Biology"},{"sentence":"The compound was tested to ensure it was non-tumorigenic before clinical trials.","translation":"その化合物は臨床試験の前に非腫瘍形成性であることを確認するために試験された。","type":"general","meaning_category":"Pharmaceuticals"}]}

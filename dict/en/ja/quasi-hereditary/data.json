In mathematics, 'hereditary' often refers to properties that are passed down or inherited in a certain structure. Thus, 'quasi-hereditary' suggests a structure that has properties resembling those of a hereditary structure, but with some modifications or weaker conditions.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/ˌkwa.zaɪ.hɪˈrɛ.dɪ.tɛ.ri/","syllables":"qua-si-he-red-i-ta-ry"},"inflection":{"notes":"This is an adjective, so it can be used to modify nouns.

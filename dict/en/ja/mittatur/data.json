It's the third-person singular, present tense, passive subjunctive of the verb 'mittō'. The subjunctive mood is used to express a range of meanings, including possibility, desire, or hypothetical situations. The passive voice indicates that the subject of the verb is receiving the action, rather than performing it. Thus, 'mittatur' means 'let him/her/it be sent' or 'may he/she/it be sent'.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{},"related_words":{"derivatives":["missiō (noun: sending, dispatching)","missilis (adjective: that may be thrown)","mittens (English, derived from Latin, related to sending out hands)"],"related_verbs":["adimittō (to let go to, allow to go to)","dīmittō (to send away, dismiss)","ēmittō (to send out, emit)","immitto (to send into)","intermittō (to interrupt, discontinue)","omittō (to leave out, neglect)","permittō (to allow, permit)","prōmittō (to promise)","remittō (to send back, relax)","submittō (to submit)","transmittō (to transmit)"]},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"N/A","frequency_google_ngram":"Low","priority":"N/A"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"N/A","text":"This is a Latin verb form.

'Addict' originates from the Latin word 'addictus,' the past participle of 'addicere,' meaning 'to deliver, to devote, to surrender.' In Roman law, 'addictus' referred to a debtor who was formally assigned to a creditor. The sense of being devoted or surrendered eventually evolved into the modern meaning of being compulsively dependent on something.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/əˈdɪktɪvli/","syllables":"ad-dic-tive-ly"},"inflection":{"notes":"As an adverb, 'addictively' does not have different forms for inflection."},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Addictively' describes something that is so enjoyable or compelling that it is difficult to stop or give up.

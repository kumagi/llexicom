This, in turn, comes from the Latin word 'confinis,' meaning 'bordering, adjacent,' from 'con-' (together) and 'finis' (end, boundary). The suffix '-ing' turns it into a present participle or gerund, and '-ly' transforms it into an adverb.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/kənˈfaɪnɪŋli/","syllables":"con-fin-ing-ly"},"inflection":{"notes":"Adverb, no inflection."},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Confiningly' is an adverb that describes how something is done in a restrictive or limiting manner.

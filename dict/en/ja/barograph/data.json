It consists of an aneroid capsule, which expands and contracts with changes in air pressure, connected to a mechanism that draws a graph on a rotating drum or chart. This graph, called a barogram, provides a visual representation of pressure fluctuations, useful for tracking weather systems and forecasting changes. Unlike a barometer, which shows the current pressure, a barograph *records* a history of pressure measurements."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The **barograph** showed a rapid drop in atmospheric pressure, indicating an approaching storm.","translation":"気圧計は急激な気圧の低下を示し、嵐が近づいていることを示しました。","type":"Typical use","meaning_category":"Recording pressure change."},{"sentence":"Meteorologists rely on data from **barographs** and other instruments to create accurate weather forecasts.","translation":"気象学者は、正確な天気予報を作成するために、気圧計やその他の機器からのデータに依存しています。","type":"Professional context","meaning_category":"Meteorological application."},{"sentence":"The pilot checked the **barograph** readings before takeoff to ensure stable weather conditions.","translation":"パイロットは離陸前に気圧計の読み取り値をチェックして、安定した天候条件であることを確認しました。","type":"Specific context","meaning_category":"Aviation application."}]}

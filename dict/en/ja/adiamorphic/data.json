Metamorphism is the process by which rocks are altered by heat, pressure, or other natural agencies. Therefore, adiamorphic rocks retain their original structure and composition, lacking the crystalline structure that is characteristic of metamorphic rocks. This term is primarily encountered in advanced geological studies and literature. Understanding this term requires familiarity with basic geological concepts such as rock types and metamorphic processes."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The geologist identified the sample as an adiamorphic sandstone.","translation":"地質学者はそのサンプルを非変成砂岩と特定した。","type":"general","meaning_category":"geology"},{"sentence":"The adiamorphic nature of the rock indicated a lack of tectonic activity in the region.","translation":"その岩石の非変成的な性質は、その地域における構造活動の欠如を示していた。","type":"technical","meaning_category":"geology"}]}

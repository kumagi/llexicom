This includes its origin, its evolution, its large-scale structure, and its ultimate fate. Cosmologists often work with theories of physics, such as general relativity and quantum mechanics, to develop models of the universe. They also use observational data from telescopes and other instruments to test these models.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ He is a cosmetology.","correct":"✓ He is a cosmologist.","note":"\"Cosmetology\" is the study of beauty treatments, while \"cosmology\" is the study of the universe."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["cosmology (宇宙論)","cosmological (宇宙論の)"],"phrasal_verbs":[],"related_fields":["astronomy","astrophysics","physics","particle physics","general relativity","quantum mechanics"],"priority":"★★★"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"The term \"cosmologist\" refers to a scientist specializing in cosmology, a field of study concerned with the origin, evolution, and eventual fate of the universe.

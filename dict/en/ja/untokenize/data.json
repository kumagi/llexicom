It refers to the process of converting a sequence of tokens (individual words or parts of words) back into a readable string of text. This is often necessary after various NLP tasks like tagging, parsing, or machine translation. The goal is to reconstruct the original text as closely as possible, including punctuation and spacing.","priority":"N/A"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ I need to untoken the document for analysis.","correct":"✓ I need to tokenize the document for analysis.","note":"Make sure you are using the correct term.

It's often used in discussions about science, philosophy, or logic. If a statement or theory has unrefutability, it means there's no way to test it or find evidence that disproves it. This can be a problem because it means the idea might not be very useful or reliable. For example, if someone claims something is true but there's no way to check if they're right or wrong, their claim has unrefutability.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The politician's vague promises were criticized for their unrefutability, making it impossible to hold him accountable.","translation":"政治家の曖昧な約束は、その反駁不可能性が批判され、彼に責任を負わせることを不可能にした。","type":"general","meaning_category":"general"},{"sentence":"The unrefutability of the hypothesis made it difficult to test using the scientific method.","translation":"その仮説の反駁不可能性は、科学的方法を用いて検証することを困難にした。","type":"scientific","meaning_category":"scientific"},{"sentence":"The philosopher argued that the concept's unrefutability rendered it meaningless in practical terms.","translation":"哲学者は、その概念の反駁不可能性が、実際的な意味において無意味にしていると主張した。","type":"philosophical","meaning_category":"philosophical"}]}

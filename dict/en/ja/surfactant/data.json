This dual nature allows them to reduce surface tension between liquids, solids, and gases. They are essential in many applications, including detergents, emulsifiers, wetting agents, and foaming agents. In the human body, pulmonary surfactant is crucial for proper lung function.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Surfactant is when you wash your hands.","correct":"✓ Surfactant is a substance used in soap to help wash your hands.","note":"Surfactant is a type of chemical, not an action."},{"incorrect":"✗ Surfactants are only used in cleaning products.","correct":"✓ Surfactants are used in a variety of products, including cleaning products, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals.","note":"Surfactants have a wide range of applications beyond just cleaning."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["surface tension (表面張力)","emulsifier (乳化剤)","detergent (洗剤)"],"phrasal_verbs":[]},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C1","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency","priority":"★★☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"The word 'surfactant' is a technical term primarily used in chemistry, biology, and engineering contexts. It refers to a substance that lowers the surface tension of a liquid, allowing it to spread more easily. This concept is important in understanding how detergents work, how emulsions are stabilized, and even how our lungs function. Due to its specialized nature, it is not commonly used in everyday conversation and is more likely to be encountered in scientific or technical texts."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The detergent contains a **surfactant** to help lift grease from the dishes.","translation":"その洗剤には、食器から油を浮き上がらせるのを助ける界面活性剤が含まれています。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"界面活性剤"},{"sentence":"A lack of pulmonary **surfactant** can cause respiratory distress in premature infants.","translation":"肺サーファクタントの不足は、未熟児に呼吸窮迫を引き起こす可能性があります。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"界面活性剤"},{"sentence":"The **surfactant** molecules arrange themselves at the interface between the oil and water.","translation":"界面活性剤分子は、油と水の界面に整列します。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"界面活性剤"}]}

It is derived from the Latin word 'diffringere,' meaning 'to break in pieces,' which is composed of 'dis-' (apart) and 'frangere' (to break).","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/dɪˈfræktɪd/","syllables":"dif-frac-ted"},"inflection":{"verb_forms":{"present_simple":["diffract","diffracts"],"past_simple":"diffracted","past_participle":"diffracted","present_participle":"diffracting"}},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Diffracted' is the past participle and past tense form of the verb 'diffract.' It describes the phenomenon of diffraction, which occurs when waves (such as light, sound, or particles) encounter an obstacle or aperture that is comparable in size to their wavelength. This causes the waves to bend or spread out. The term is commonly used in physics and optics.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The light was refracted.","correct":"✓ The light was diffracted.","note":"'Diffraction' and 'refraction' are different phenomena. Diffraction involves the bending of waves around obstacles or through apertures, while refraction involves the bending of waves as they pass from one medium to another. It is important to use the correct term to describe the specific phenomenon occurring."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["diffract (verb)","diffraction (noun)","diffractive (adjective)"],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C1","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Diffracted' is a technical term primarily used in physics and optics to describe the bending and spreading of waves (like light or sound) when they encounter an obstacle or pass through a narrow opening.

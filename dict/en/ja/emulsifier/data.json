It works by reducing the surface tension between the liquids, allowing them to form a stable mixture called an emulsion. Emulsifiers are commonly used in the food industry to improve the texture and stability of products like mayonnaise, ice cream, and salad dressings. They are also used in various industrial applications, such as the production of paints, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Emulsifiers are important for emulsification.","correct":"✓ Emulsifiers are important for emulsion.","note":"\"Emulsification\" is the process of forming an emulsion, while \"emulsion\" is the stable mixture itself.

It describes a process where a bacteriophage (a virus that infects bacteria) incorporates its genetic material into the host bacterium's DNA without immediately destroying the cell. Instead, the viral DNA, now called a prophage, replicates along with the bacterial DNA during cell division. This allows the virus to remain dormant within the host until certain conditions trigger it to enter the lytic cycle, where it replicates and destroys the host cell. Understanding lysogenesis requires knowledge of basic virology and genetics.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"During lysogenesis, the viral genome is integrated into the host cell's chromosome.","translation":"溶原性の間、ウイルスゲノムは宿主細胞の染色体に組み込まれる。","type":"general","meaning_category":"General"},{"sentence":"Lysogenesis can lead to the transfer of genetic material between bacteria.","translation":"溶原性は、細菌間の遺伝物質の伝達につながる可能性がある。","type":"general","meaning_category":"General"},{"sentence":"Temperate phages are capable of both lytic and lysogenic cycles.","translation":"温和ファージは、溶菌性サイクルと溶原性サイクルの両方が可能である。","type":"technical","meaning_category":"Technical"}]}

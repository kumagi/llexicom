When light strikes the photosensitive surface (photocathode) inside the tube, electrons are emitted. These electrons are then attracted to the anode, creating an electrical current that is proportional to the intensity of the incident light.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The phototube amplifies light.","correct":"✓ The phototube converts light into an electrical current.","note":"Phototubes do not amplify light; they convert light into an electrical current.

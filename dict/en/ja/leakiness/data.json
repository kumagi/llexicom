It's often found in technical descriptions of containers, pipes, systems, or even biological membranes.  The word emphasizes the *tendency* to leak rather than the act of leaking itself. It suggests an inherent flaw or imperfection causing the seepage. It’s not a common everyday word but is crucial in fields like engineering and medicine."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The engineers were concerned about the **leakiness** of the new valve design.","translation":"エンジニアたちは新しいバルブ設計の漏れやすさが心配だった。","type":"technical context","meaning_category":"valve's imperfect seal"},{"sentence":"The **leakiness** of the blood-brain barrier can indicate neurological problems.","translation":"血液脳関門の漏れやすさは、神経学的問題を示す可能性がある。","type":"medical context","meaning_category":"permeability of a biological membrane"},{"sentence":"Despite the sealant, there was still some **leakiness** around the window frame.","translation":"シーラントを使用しても、窓枠の周りにはまだ漏れやすさがあった。","type":"practical context","meaning_category":"imperfect sealing of a window"},{"sentence":"The **leakiness** was assessed using a pressure test.","translation":"漏れやすさは圧力テストで評価された。","type":"technical/scientific","meaning_category":"measurement of seepage"}]}

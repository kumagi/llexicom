The addition of '-er' turns it into a noun describing someone who does this, and '-s' makes it plural. It suggests a parasitic relationship where individuals attach themselves to someone more powerful or influential for their own benefit.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/ˈhæŋərz ɒn/","syllables":"hang-ers-on"},"inflection":{"noun_plural":"hangers-on (already plural, no change)"},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Hangers-on' is a derogatory term used to describe people who associate with someone important or famous, often for personal gain or advantage.

It's a negative term, suggesting that these people are insincere and only interested in what they can get from the relationship. Think of them as followers who don't have their own independent goals or identity. They \"hang on\" to someone else for their own benefit.

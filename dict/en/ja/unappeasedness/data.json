'Unappeased' is formed from the prefix 'un-' (not) + 'appeased' (past participle of 'appease'). 'Appease' comes from Old French 'apaisier' (to pacify), from 'a pais' (to peace), ultimately from Latin 'pax' (peace).","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/ˌʌnəˈpiːzdnəs/","syllables":"un-ap-peased-ness"},"inflection":{"noun_plural":"unappeasednesses (rarely used)"},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Unappeasedness' is a relatively uncommon noun that describes the state or quality of being unappeased.

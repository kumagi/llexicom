Understanding this term requires knowledge of basic organic chemistry concepts such as benzene rings and sulfonic acid groups. It is typically encountered in advanced chemistry courses or scientific publications. The term refers to a phenyl group (C6H5) that has been modified by the addition of a sulfonic acid group (-SO3H). This modification can significantly alter the chemical properties of the molecule to which it is attached, such as increasing its solubility in water."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The dye molecule contains multiple sulphophenyl groups to enhance its water solubility.","translation":"その色素分子は、水溶性を高めるために複数のスルホフェニル基を含んでいます。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"chemical structure"},{"sentence":"The sulphophenyl derivative was synthesized using a sulfonation reaction.","translation":"スルホフェニル誘導体は、スルホン化反応を用いて合成されました。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"chemical synthesis"}]}

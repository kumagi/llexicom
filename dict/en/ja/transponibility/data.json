It's often used in technical or academic fields when discussing whether a particular technology, skill, or method can be successfully applied in a different context. For example, you might talk about the 'transponibility' of a manufacturing process from one factory to another, or the 'transponibility' of a teaching method from one school to another. It's a more specialized term than 'transferability' or 'applicability,' so it's usually only used in specific, technical discussions."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The report examines the transponibility of best practices in healthcare management to developing countries.","translation":"その報告書は、医療経営におけるベストプラクティスの発展途上国への移転可能性を検証しています。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"移転可能性"},{"sentence":"Researchers are studying the transponibility of AI algorithms across different data sets.","translation":"研究者たちは、異なるデータセット間でのAIアルゴリズムの転用可能性を研究しています。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"転用可能性"},{"sentence":"The transponibility of the training module to an online format was a key consideration.","translation":"トレーニングモジュールをオンライン形式に適用できるかどうかが重要な検討事項でした。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"適用可能性"}]}

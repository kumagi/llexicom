It refers to the act of relinquishing one's claim or right to a property. This is typically done through a 'quitclaim deed,' which transfers any interest the grantor has to the grantee without guaranteeing ownership or a clear title. It's important to understand that quitclaiming is not the same as selling property with a warranty deed, as it offers no protection against existing claims or defects in the title. This term is most often encountered in legal documents, real estate transactions, or legal discussions.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"She is quitclaiming her share of the inheritance to her brother.","translation":"彼女は相続分の彼女の分け前を彼女の兄弟に放棄している。","type":"verb (gerund)","meaning_category":"放棄すること"},{"sentence":"Quitclaiming is often used in divorce settlements to transfer property rights.","translation":"権利放棄は、離婚の和解において不動産権を移転するためによく使用される。","type":"verb (gerund)","meaning_category":"放棄すること"},{"sentence":"He is quitclaiming all rights to the mineral deposits on the land.","translation":"彼はその土地の鉱物埋蔵物に対するすべての権利を放棄している。","type":"verb (present participle)","meaning_category":"放棄すること"}]}

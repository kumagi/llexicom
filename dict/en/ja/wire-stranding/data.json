It describes the process of twisting individual wires together to form a stronger, more flexible cable. This is important because a single solid wire can be brittle and prone to breaking, especially when bent repeatedly. The resulting \"stranded wire\" is more durable and can withstand more stress. Understanding this term is essential for anyone working with electrical wiring or cable manufacturing."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The **wire-stranding** process improves the flexibility of the cable.","translation":"電線撚り合わせ工程はケーブルの柔軟性を向上させます。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"電線撚り合わせ"},{"sentence":"The company invested in a new **wire-stranding** machine.","translation":"その会社は新しい電線撚り合わせ機に投資しました。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"電線撚り合わせ"},{"sentence":"They **wire-strand** the copper wires to create a flexible cable.","translation":"彼らは柔軟なケーブルを作るために銅線を撚り合わせます。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"電線を撚り合わせる"}]}

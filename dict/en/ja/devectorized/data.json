It refers to the process of converting an image or graphic from a vector format (where images are represented by mathematical equations) to a raster format (where images are represented by pixels). This conversion is often done for compatibility reasons or to reduce file size, but it can result in a loss of image quality when scaled up.","priority":"N/A"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[],"priority":"N/A"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["devectorization (noun)","vectorize (verb)","vectorized (adjective)","vector (noun)","raster (noun)"],"phrasal_verbs":[]},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"N/A","frequency_google_ngram":"Low","priority":"N/A"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Devectorized' is a technical term mainly used in computer graphics.

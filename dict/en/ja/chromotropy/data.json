It refers to the ability of a chemical substance to exhibit different colors depending on its concentration in a solution. This phenomenon is related to the way molecules interact with light and how their aggregation state changes with concentration. It is a relatively advanced concept, so it is typically encountered in specialized scientific literature or advanced chemistry courses."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The dye exhibited significant chromotropy in aqueous solutions.","translation":"その染料は水溶液中で顕著なクロモトロピーを示した。","type":"scientific","meaning_category":"chemical property"},{"sentence":"Chromotropy can be used to study the aggregation behavior of molecules.","translation":"クロモトロピーは、分子の凝集挙動を研究するために利用できる。","type":"scientific","meaning_category":"chemical phenomenon"}]}

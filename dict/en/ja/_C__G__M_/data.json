It is a medical device used by people with diabetes to track their blood glucose levels in real-time throughout the day and night. Unlike traditional blood glucose meters that require finger pricks, CGMs use a small sensor inserted under the skin to measure glucose levels in interstitial fluid. The data is transmitted wirelessly to a receiver or smartphone, allowing users to monitor trends and make informed decisions about their diet, exercise, and medication.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ I use CGM every time I check my blood sugar.","correct":"✓ I use a CGM to continuously monitor my blood sugar.","note":"CGM refers to the device itself, not the act of checking blood sugar.

It's a medical device that people with diabetes use to keep track of their blood sugar levels all the time. Instead of pricking their finger to check their blood sugar, they wear a small sensor under their skin that sends the information to a device or phone. This helps them manage their diabetes better by seeing how their blood sugar changes throughout the day.

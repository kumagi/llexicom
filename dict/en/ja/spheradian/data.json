It is used to measure solid angles, which are like two-dimensional angles but extended into three dimensions. A complete sphere subtends a solid angle of 4π steradians at its center.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[],"priority":"☆☆☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["sphere","radian","solid angle"],"phrasal_verbs":[],"priority":"☆☆☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency","priority":"☆☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Spheradian' is a technical term used in physics and mathematics to measure solid angles.

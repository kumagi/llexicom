This impairment can result from genetic mutations, structural changes, or interactions with other molecules. It is often used in the context of transcription factors and other proteins that regulate gene expression. A DNA-binding-impaired protein may not be able to properly regulate gene expression, leading to various cellular consequences.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The protein is DNA binding impaired.","correct":"✓ The protein is DNA-binding-impaired.","note":"The hyphenation is important for clarity.

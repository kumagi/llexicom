It describes a substance that exists as a single isomer. Isomers are molecules with the same chemical formula but different spatial arrangements of atoms. A unisomeric substance is therefore stereochemically pure, meaning it contains only one specific isomer. This is important in fields like pharmaceuticals, where different isomers of a drug can have different effects. The concept requires a solid understanding of stereochemistry and isomerism.

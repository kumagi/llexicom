It is commonly used in two main contexts: 1) in chemistry and engineering to describe the conversion of a solid or gas into a liquid, and 2) in geology and geotechnical engineering to describe the phenomenon where soil loses its strength and stiffness in response to an applied stress, such as during an earthquake. The geological sense is particularly important in earthquake-prone areas.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The liquefaction made the building stand still.","correct":"✓ The liquefaction made the building sink.","note":"Liquefaction causes structures to lose support and sink or collapse, not stand still."},{"incorrect":"✗ Liquidation is the same as liquefaction.","correct":"✓ Liquidation refers to the process of converting assets into cash, while liquefaction refers to the process of making something liquid.","note":"'Liquidation' is a financial term, whereas 'liquefaction' is a physical process."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["liquefy (verb: to make liquid)","liquefiable (adjective: capable of being liquefied)"],"related_scientific_terms":["thixotropy (チキソトロピー)","soil mechanics (土質力学)","seismology (地震学)"],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C1","frequency_google_ngram":"Relatively low frequency, technical term.","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Liquefaction' is a technical term that primarily refers to the process of something becoming liquid.

It's named after Thomas Bowdler, who published a version of Shakespeare with all the 'unsuitable' parts removed. The word is often used negatively, suggesting that the original work has been unnecessarily changed. It's more specific than just 'censoring' or 'editing' because it focuses on removing content that is seen as indecent or offensive.

It's often used in formal or technical contexts where building trust is a key objective. The word combines the concept of 'trust' with the action of 'advocating,' meaning to publicly support or recommend something. Therefore, a 'trust-advocating' approach is one that prioritizes and encourages the development of trust. This term is more complex and less frequently used than simpler alternatives like 'trust-promoting' or 'trust-building'."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The government's trust-advocating campaign aims to restore public confidence in the electoral process.","translation":"政府の信頼を推進するキャンペーンは、選挙プロセスに対する国民の信頼を回復することを目的としています。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"promoting trust"},{"sentence":"A trust-advocating culture within the organization is essential for effective teamwork.","translation":"組織内の信頼を推進する文化は、効果的なチームワークに不可欠です。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"fostering trust"},{"sentence":"The new regulations are designed to be trust-advocating, ensuring greater transparency and accountability.","translation":"新しい規制は、より高い透明性と説明責任を確保し、信頼を推進するように設計されています。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"building trust"}]}

It describes a state or form that exists before inflection occurs. Inflection is the process of changing the form of a word to indicate grammatical functions such as tense, number, or gender. Therefore, a preinflectional stage is one where words have not yet undergone these changes or belong to a language family that does not rely heavily on inflection.

This means that people who are seminomadic live in a fixed place for part of the year, but also move around with their animals for the rest of the year. This is often because they need to find new pastures for their animals to graze on. The term is not commonly used in everyday conversation, but it is important to understand if you are reading about cultures or history. It is more specialized than \"nomadic\" or \"settled.\""},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The **seminomadic** people of the region rely on both agriculture and animal husbandry for their survival.","translation":"その地域の半遊牧民は、農業と畜産業の両方に頼って生活している。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"半遊牧の"},{"sentence":"Their **seminomadic** existence allows them to adapt to the changing seasons and resource availability.","translation":"彼らの半遊牧的な生活は、季節の変化や資源の利用可能性に適応することを可能にする。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"半遊牧の"},{"sentence":"Archaeological evidence suggests that the area was once inhabited by **seminomadic** groups.","translation":"考古学的証拠は、その地域がかつて半遊牧民によって居住されていたことを示唆している。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"半遊牧の"}]}

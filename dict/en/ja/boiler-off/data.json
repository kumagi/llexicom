It describes the process where cryogenic propellants, like liquid hydrogen or liquid oxygen, naturally evaporate over time due to heat absorption. This is a critical consideration for long-duration space missions because it reduces the amount of propellant available, limiting the mission's lifespan. Advanced insulation and cooling systems are often used to minimize boiler-off.","priority":"N/A"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The engineers carefully monitored the boiler-off rate during the test.","translation":"エンジニアは試験中に自然蒸発率を注意深く監視した。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"自然蒸発"},{"sentence":"The design of the fuel tank aimed to minimize boiler-off during transit.","translation":"燃料タンクの設計は、輸送中の自然蒸発を最小限に抑えることを目的としていた。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"自然蒸発"}]}

This design principle promotes modularity, reusability, and testability. It is often contrasted with 'dependency-aware' designs, where components are tightly coupled and rely on specific external resources or services.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The module is dependency-blind of the database.","correct":"✓ The module is dependency-blind to the database.","note":"The correct preposition to use with 'dependency-blind' in this context is 'to'."},{"incorrect":"✗ Dependency-blindness is always good.","correct":"✓ While dependency-blindness can offer advantages, it's not always the best approach, as it can sometimes lead to code duplication or reduced efficiency.","note":"While dependency-blindness offers benefits, it's important to recognize that it's not a universally superior approach.

Although it has advantages, it's not always the best approach, as it can sometimes lead to code duplication.

It is often used in the context of materials that can be decomposed by natural processes, such as bacteria. While sometimes used interchangeably with 'biodegradable', 'degradable' can also refer to breakdown through other processes like oxidation or UV light exposure, which may not necessarily be environmentally friendly. 'Biodegradable' specifically implies breakdown by living organisms into harmless natural substances. 'Degradable' can also describe something that deteriorates in quality.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The degradable was thrown away.","correct":"✓ The degradable waste was thrown away.","note":"'Degradable' is an adjective and needs to modify a noun.

It's important to know that 'degradable' isn't quite the same as 'biodegradable'. 'Biodegradable' means something breaks down naturally by living things like bacteria, while 'degradable' can break down through other processes too.

Understanding this term requires a strong background in biology and medicine, as it relates to the complex processes of tumor development and progression. The prefix 'pro-' indicates promotion, and 'neoplastic' refers to abnormal new growth (neoplasms or tumors). Thus, 'pro-neoplastic' describes factors or conditions that encourage or facilitate the growth of tumors. Due to its technical nature, it is not commonly encountered outside of specialized literature and discussions within the medical and scientific communities."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"Chronic inflammation can create a pro-neoplastic microenvironment, fostering tumor growth.","translation":"慢性的な炎症は、腫瘍の成長を促進する腫瘍形成促進的な微小環境を作り出す可能性がある。","type":"general","meaning_category":"promoting tumor growth"},{"sentence":"The study investigated the pro-neoplastic effects of a specific signaling pathway in breast cancer cells.","translation":"その研究では、乳癌細胞における特定のシグナル伝達経路の腫瘍形成促進効果を調査した。","type":"research","meaning_category":"effects promoting tumors"}]}

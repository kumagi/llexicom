While grammatically correct, it's not commonly used in modern English. The terms 'female pastor' or simply 'pastor' (as 'pastor' is increasingly used in a gender-neutral way) are more frequently encountered. Understanding this word is helpful for recognizing older texts or contexts where gendered titles were more prevalent, but it's generally not recommended for active use in contemporary speech or writing."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The pastoress led the congregation in prayer.","translation":"女性牧師は会衆を率いて祈りを捧げた。","type":"general","meaning_category":"Female pastor"},{"sentence":"The church appointed a pastoress to serve the growing community.","translation":"教会は成長するコミュニティのために女性牧師を任命した。","type":"general","meaning_category":"Female pastor"}]}

'Haploid' refers to the number of chromosomes in gametes (sex cells), while 'monoploid' refers to the basic chromosome number of a species. In many cases, they are the same, but in polyploid species (species with multiple sets of chromosomes), the haploid number is different from the monoploid number.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"The monoploid cell has two sets of chromosomes.","correct":"The monoploid cell has one set of chromosomes.","note":"Monoploid cells, by definition, have only one set of chromosomes."}],"priority":"★★★"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["monoploidy"],"related_terms":["haploid","diploid","polyploid","chromosome","genome"]},"level_frequency":{"frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency - Primarily used in scientific contexts.","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"The term 'monoploid' is a technical term used in genetics and biology to describe cells or organisms that have only one set of chromosomes.

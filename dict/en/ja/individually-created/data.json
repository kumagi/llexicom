It implies a level of craftsmanship and attention to detail that is not typically found in mass-produced items. This term is more commonly used in contexts where the origin and uniqueness of the item are important, such as in art, crafts, or custom design. The hyphenation helps to clarify that 'individually' modifies 'created' to form a single adjective.

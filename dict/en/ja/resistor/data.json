It's like a narrow pipe for water, making it harder for the water to pass through. Resistors are used to control the amount of electricity in a circuit, protecting other parts from getting too much power. The amount of resistance is measured in ohms.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The engineer added a **resistor** to the circuit to reduce the current.","translation":"エンジニアは電流を減らすために回路に抵抗器を追加しました。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"electrical component"},{"sentence":"The **resistor** burned out due to excessive voltage.","translation":"過剰な電圧のため、抵抗器が焼けました。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"electrical component"},{"sentence":"The color bands on the **resistor** indicate its resistance value.","translation":"抵抗器のカラーバンドはその抵抗値を示しています。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"electrical component"}]}

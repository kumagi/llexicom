It means 'somewhat like a murmur.' Because it is not a standard word, it is best used in informal contexts where the speaker wants to convey a sense of approximation or slight resemblance to a murmur. It is more likely to be understood by those with a strong vocabulary and an understanding of how suffixes work in English.

It's more descriptive than just saying 'noisy' because it suggests a loud, continuous, and often chaotic noise. You might use it to describe a busy construction site or a crowded market. Because it's not a common word, using it can make your writing more vivid, but be aware that some readers may not know what it means. It is more frequently used in descriptive writing than in everyday conversation."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The clammersome machinery made conversation impossible.","translation":"騒がしい機械のせいで会話は不可能だった。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"noisy"},{"sentence":"Despite the clammersome atmosphere, she managed to concentrate on her work.","translation":"騒がしい雰囲気にもかかわらず、彼女は仕事に集中することができた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"noisy"},{"sentence":"The clammersome festival filled the streets with music and laughter.","translation":"騒がしい祭りが通りを音楽と笑い声で満たした。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"noisy"}]}

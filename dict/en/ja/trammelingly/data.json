'Trammel' comes from the Old French word 'tramail,' referring to a fishing net used to entangle fish. The suffix '-ingly' transforms the verb into an adverb, indicating the manner in which something is done.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/ˈtræmələŋli/","syllables":"tram-mel-ing-ly"},"inflection":{"notes":"This word is an adverb, formed by adding '-ly' to the adjective 'trammeling,' which is the present participle of the verb 'trammel.'"},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Trammelingly' describes actions or situations that impose limitations or restrictions, often in a way that is perceived as burdensome or oppressive. It suggests a sense of being caught or entangled, similar to how a fishing net (the original meaning of 'trammel') would trap fish. The word is relatively uncommon and tends to be used in more formal or literary contexts.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ She spoke trammelingly about her feelings.","correct":"✓ She spoke haltingly about her feelings.","note":"'Trammelingly' refers to external restrictions, not internal hesitation.

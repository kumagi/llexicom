It's a scientific term primarily used in biology, microbiology, and related fields. Understanding this term requires some background knowledge in these areas, as it relates to specific metabolic processes and environmental conditions. The adjective form, 'anaerobic,' describes processes or environments lacking oxygen. This term is more commonly encountered in discussions of exercise physiology (anaerobic exercise) and industrial processes (anaerobic digestion)."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The scientist studied the growth of anaerobes in a controlled environment.","translation":"科学者は管理された環境下での嫌気性生物の成長を研究した。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"嫌気性生物"},{"sentence":"Anaerobic bacteria play a crucial role in the decomposition of organic matter in wetlands.","translation":"嫌気性細菌は湿地帯における有機物の分解に重要な役割を果たす。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"嫌気性の"},{"sentence":"Anaerobic digestion is used to treat wastewater and produce biogas.","translation":"嫌気性消化は廃水処理とバイオガスの生産に利用されている。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"嫌気性の"},{"sentence":"Some species of Clostridium are obligate anaerobes.","translation":"クロストリジウム属のいくつかの種は偏性嫌気性菌である。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"嫌気性生物"}]}

The comparative form 'nicer' simply indicates a greater degree of these positive qualities.","priority":"★★★"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/ˈnaɪsər/","syllables":"ni-cer"},"inflection":{"adjective_forms":{"base":"nice","comparative":"nicer","superlative":"nicest"}},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Nicer' is used to compare two things or people, indicating that one is more pleasant, kind, or attractive than the other.

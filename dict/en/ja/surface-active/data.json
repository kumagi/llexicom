These substances, often called surfactants, have both hydrophobic (water-repelling) and hydrophilic (water-attracting) parts in their molecules. This dual nature allows them to accumulate at interfaces, reducing surface tension and enabling the mixing of substances that would not normally mix, such as oil and water.","priority":"☆☆☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The molecule is surface activity.","correct":"✓ The molecule has surface activity. / ✓ The molecule is surface-active.","note":"'Surface activity' is a noun phrase, while 'surface-active' is an adjective.

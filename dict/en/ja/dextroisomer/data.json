Optical isomers are molecules that are mirror images of each other and are non-superimposable. Dextroisomers are distinguished by their ability to rotate plane-polarized light in a clockwise direction. The term 'dextro-' comes from the Latin word for 'right'. Dextroisomers are often denoted by the prefix 'd-' or '(+)-'.

It refers to an isomer that has the property of rotating plane-polarized light in a clockwise direction. Isomers are molecules with the same chemical formula but different arrangements of atoms. The prefix 'dextro-' indicates 'right' or 'clockwise'. This term is primarily encountered in organic chemistry and biochemistry when discussing chiral molecules and their interactions with polarized light. Understanding this term requires a background in basic chemistry principles.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The pharmaceutical company synthesized the dextroisomer of the drug to improve its efficacy.","translation":"その製薬会社は薬効を高めるために、その薬の右旋性異性体を合成した。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"右旋性異性体"},{"sentence":"Scientists used polarimetry to identify the presence of the dextroisomer in the sample.","translation":"科学者たちは偏光法を用いて、サンプル中の右旋性異性体の存在を特定した。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"右旋性異性体"}]}

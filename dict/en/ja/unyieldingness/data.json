'Unyielding' itself is formed from the prefix 'un-' (meaning 'not') and the present participle 'yielding' of the verb 'yield.' The verb 'yield' comes from Old English 'gieldan,' meaning 'to pay, give up, submit.' Thus, 'unyieldingness' describes the state of not giving way or submitting.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/ʌnˈjiːldɪŋnəs/","syllables":"un-yield-ing-ness"},"inflection":{"notes":"This is a noun and does not have different inflections."},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Unyieldingness' describes a strong and often admirable quality of steadfastness and determination. However, it can also have negative connotations when it implies excessive stubbornness or an unwillingness to compromise, even when compromise is necessary or beneficial.

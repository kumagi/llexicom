It implies a level of skill, care, and attention to detail traditionally associated with women's work, such as sewing, knitting, quilting, or other domestic crafts. While the term itself is not inherently negative, it can be perceived as gendered and potentially limiting, as it suggests that certain qualities are specific to women's work. In contemporary usage, more neutral terms like \"skillful,\" \"diligent,\" or \"meticulous\" are often preferred.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ He approached the task with workwomanly precision.","correct":"✓ She approached the task with workwomanly precision.","note":"While not grammatically incorrect, using \"workwomanly\" to describe a man's work may sound unusual, as the term is specifically associated with female workers. A more neutral term like \"skillful\" or \"meticulous\" would be more appropriate. However, if the male is doing traditionally female work, it is acceptable."}],"priority":"★☆☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["workwoman (noun: a female worker, especially one skilled in a craft)"],"phrases":["workmanlike (adjective: exhibiting skill and competence, but not necessarily associated with a specific gender)"],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"N/A (uncommon word)","frequency_google_ngram":"Very low frequency - usage has declined significantly over time.","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C2","text":"The word \"workwomanly\" is a relatively rare and specialized term. It describes a quality of work that is skillful, diligent, and meticulous, typically associated with women's traditional crafts or domestic tasks. Understanding this word requires a good grasp of historical context and gendered associations in language. It's important to recognize that while the word itself is not inherently negative, its use can be perceived as outdated or even sexist in modern contexts, as it reinforces gender stereotypes about work. Therefore, it's generally better to use more neutral terms like \"skillful,\" \"diligent,\" or \"meticulous\" to describe someone's work, regardless of their gender."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The embroidery was done with **workwomanly** skill.","translation":"その刺繍は女性らしい職人技で作られました。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"女性らしい仕事ぶり"},{"sentence":"She handled the delicate fabric with **workwomanly** care.","translation":"彼女は女性らしい丁寧さで繊細な生地を扱いました。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"女性らしい手腕"},{"sentence":"The restoration was completed with **workwomanly** precision.","translation":"修復は女性らしい正確さで完了しました。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"女性らしい職人技"}]}

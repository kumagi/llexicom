It refers to the state of a metal, usually steel, after it has been heated to a temperature where its crystal structure transforms into the austenite phase. This process is often a precursor to further heat treatments like quenching or tempering. Understanding this term requires knowledge of materials science principles."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The sample was first austenitized to ensure a uniform microstructure.","translation":"均一な微細構造を確保するために、サンプルを最初にオーステナイト化しました。","type":"verb (past participle)","meaning_category":"heat treatment"},{"sentence":"Austenitized stainless steel exhibits improved corrosion resistance.","translation":"オーステナイト化されたステンレス鋼は、耐食性が向上します。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"material property"},{"sentence":"The austenitized condition is necessary before the steel can be hardened.","translation":"鋼を硬化させるには、オーステナイト化された状態が必要です。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"process requirement"}]}

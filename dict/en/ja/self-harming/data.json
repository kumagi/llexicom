It is often associated with underlying mental health conditions such as depression, anxiety, borderline personality disorder, and trauma. Self-harm can take many forms, including cutting, burning, scratching, hitting oneself, head-banging, and poisoning/overdosing (though not with suicidal intent). It's important to note that self-harm is not usually a suicide attempt, although it does increase the risk of suicide. It is a maladaptive coping mechanism and a sign of significant emotional distress. Individuals who engage in self-harm need professional help and support.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ He is self-harmful.","correct":"✓ He is self-harming.","note":"'Self-harmful' is less common than 'self-harming'.

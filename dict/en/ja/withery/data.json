It is most often used to describe plant life, such as leaves or flowers, that are losing their freshness and vitality. While 'withered' is more common, 'withery' adds a nuanced sense of ongoing decay. It's not a frequently used word, so it's more likely to be encountered in descriptive writing or literature."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The withery grass crunched under the hiker's boots.","translation":"ハイカーのブーツの下で、枯れかかった草がカサカサと音を立てた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"しなびた"},{"sentence":"She gathered the withery petals from the vase.","translation":"彼女は花瓶からしおれた花びらを集めた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"しおれた"},{"sentence":"The withery vines clung weakly to the crumbling wall.","translation":"枯れかかったつるが崩れかけた壁に弱々しく絡みついていた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"枯れかかった"}]}

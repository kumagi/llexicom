The adjective 'brassy' originally referred to something resembling brass, but later evolved to describe behavior that is bold, showy, or impudent, possibly due to the association of brass instruments with loud and attention-grabbing music.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/ˈbræsiɪst/","syllables":"brass-i-est"},"inflection":{"adjective_forms":{"comparative":"brassier","superlative":"brassiest"}},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Brassy' typically describes someone or something that is overly bold, confident, and sometimes even rude or vulgar. It can also refer to something that is showy or flashy in a cheap or tasteless way. The superlative form, 'brassiest,' intensifies these qualities, indicating the highest degree of boldness, impudence, or showiness. The word often carries a negative connotation, suggesting a lack of refinement or sophistication.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ She had a brassiest heart.","correct":"✓ She had a brassy attitude.","note":"'Brassy' typically describes behavior, attitude, or appearance, not inherent qualities like a heart.

This can occur due to mutations during cell division in the early stages of development. The proportion and distribution of the different cell populations can vary, leading to a range of phenotypic effects. It is important to distinguish mosaicism from chimerism, where different cell populations arise from the fusion of multiple zygotes.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The patient has mosaic.","correct":"✓ The patient has mosaicism.","note":"'Mosaic' is the adjective or the art form, while 'mosaicism' is the noun referring to the genetic condition."},{"incorrect":"✗ Mosaicism is the same as chimera.","correct":"✓ Mosaicism is different from chimerism.","note":"Mosaicism originates from a single zygote, while chimerism involves multiple zygotes."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["mosaic (形容詞: モザイク状の)","mosaic (名詞: モザイク)","chimeric (形容詞: キメラの)"],"phrasal_verbs":[],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency - specialized scientific term.","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Mosaicism' is a specialized term in genetics referring to the presence of two or more cell populations with different genetic makeups within a single individual.

It describes a material that has some, but not a high degree of, ductility. Ductility is the ability of a material to deform under tensile stress, typically by being stretched into a wire. A semiductile material can be shaped to some extent, but not as easily or extensively as a fully ductile material. The term is also sometimes used metaphorically to describe something that is somewhat flexible or adaptable, but not entirely so. Understanding this term requires familiarity with basic materials science concepts."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The engineer chose a semiductile alloy for the component because it needed to withstand some bending without breaking.","translation":"エンジニアは、部品が破損することなくある程度の曲げに耐える必要があったため、半延性合金を選択した。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"材料特性"},{"sentence":"The company adopted a semiductile approach to negotiations, allowing for some compromise but not complete capitulation.","translation":"会社は交渉に半延性のアプローチを採用し、ある程度の妥協は許容したが、完全な降伏はしなかった。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"比喩的な意味"}]}

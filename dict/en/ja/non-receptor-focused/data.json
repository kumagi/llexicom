It describes something that doesn't primarily act through receptors, which are proteins on cells that bind to specific molecules to trigger a response. Instead, it might work through other pathways or mechanisms. It's important to understand the context in which this term is used, as it's specific to scientific discussions.","priority":"medium"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The study investigated non-receptor-focused effects of the compound.","translation":"その研究では、その化合物の受容体に焦点を当てない効果が調査された。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"受容体に焦点を当てていない"},{"sentence":"We are exploring non-receptor-focused therapeutic strategies.","translation":"我々は受容体に焦点を当てない治療戦略を模索している。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"受容体に焦点を当てていない"}]}

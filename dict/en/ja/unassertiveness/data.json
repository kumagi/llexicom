It often stems from a fear of conflict, rejection, or negative judgment. While being polite and considerate of others is important, excessive unassertiveness can lead to personal dissatisfaction, resentment, and difficulties in achieving one's goals. It is often contrasted with 'assertiveness', which is a healthy balance between expressing oneself and respecting the rights and feelings of others, and 'aggressiveness', which involves expressing oneself in a forceful or hostile manner that disregards the rights and feelings of others.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ He showed a lot of unassertive.","correct":"✓ He showed a lot of unassertiveness.","note":"'Unassertiveness' is a noun, so it is not used as an adjective.

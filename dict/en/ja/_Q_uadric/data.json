In 3D space, these are quadric surfaces (e.g., ellipsoids, hyperboloids, paraboloids), and in 2D space, they are quadric curves or conic sections (e.g., ellipses, parabolas, hyperbolas). The term is primarily used in mathematics and geometry.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ A quadric is always a sphere.","correct":"✓ A sphere is a type of quadric.","note":"A quadric is a general term for a variety of shapes, not just spheres."}],"priority":"★☆☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["quadratic (adjective)","quadratically (adverb)"],"phrases":["conic section","ellipsoid","hyperboloid","paraboloid","sphere","parabola","hyperbola","ellipse"],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"The term 'quadric' is a mathematical term that refers to geometric shapes defined by second-degree polynomial equations.

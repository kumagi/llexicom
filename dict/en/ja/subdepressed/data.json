It implies that someone is experiencing depressive symptoms, but not to the extent that they would be diagnosed with major depressive disorder. The prefix \"sub-\" indicates that the condition is less severe or below the threshold of full-blown depression. It's important to note that even though it's a milder form, it can still significantly affect a person's well-being and should not be dismissed. The term is more likely to be encountered in medical or psychological contexts."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"After the stressful event, she felt mildly subdepressed.","translation":"ストレスの多い出来事の後、彼女は軽度のうつ状態を感じた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"軽度のうつ状態の"},{"sentence":"He was diagnosed as subdepressed but did not require medication.","translation":"彼は準うつ病と診断されたが、投薬治療は必要なかった。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"準うつ病の"}]}

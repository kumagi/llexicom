It's often used in academic writing, especially in fields like philosophy, sociology, and computer science. For example, you might say that someone \"reifies\" the idea of 'society' if they talk about it as if it were a single, unified entity with its own goals and desires. It's important to be aware of this term if you're reading complex theoretical texts, but it's not a word you'll encounter frequently in everyday conversation."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The artist sought to **reify** the feeling of loneliness in her sculpture.","translation":"その芸術家は、彫刻の中で孤独感を具体化しようとした。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"具体化する"},{"sentence":"The software **reifies** user preferences into personalized recommendations.","translation":"そのソフトウェアは、ユーザーの好みをパーソナライズされた推奨として実体化する。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"実体化する"},{"sentence":"It's a mistake to **reify** the concept of 'intelligence' as a single, measurable trait.","translation":"「知能」という概念を、単一の測定可能な特性として実体化するのは誤りである。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"実在のものとして扱う"}]}

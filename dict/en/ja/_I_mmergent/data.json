It has two primary meanings, one in ecology and one in social sciences. In ecology, it describes something, usually a plant, that rises out of the water. In social sciences, it describes something that arises unexpectedly from complex interactions. Because of its specialized usage, it's important to understand the context in which it is used to determine the intended meaning.

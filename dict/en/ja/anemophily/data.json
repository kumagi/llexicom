Anemophilous plants typically produce large quantities of lightweight pollen grains that are easily carried by the wind. Their flowers are often small, inconspicuous, and lack bright colors or strong scents, as they do not need to attract insects or other animal pollinators.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Anemophily is pollination by insects.","correct":"✓ Anemophily is pollination by wind.","note":"Anemophily specifically refers to wind pollination, not insect pollination."}],"priority":"★☆☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["anemophilous (adjective: wind-pollinated)"],"phrasal_verbs":[]},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Anemophily' is a specialized term in botany referring to wind pollination.

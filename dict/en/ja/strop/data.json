Primarily, it refers to a strip of leather (or other material) used for sharpening razors or knives by drawing the blade along it. It can also mean a long, narrow piece of leather used as part of equipment like reins or straps on furniture. Figuratively, 'strop' can describe something tight and restrictive, or someone with a bad temper – though this usage is less common now.

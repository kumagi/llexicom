A symmetrical distribution, like a normal distribution, has a skewness of zero. Positive skewness indicates that the tail on the right side of the distribution is longer or fatter than the tail on the left side, and the mean and median are greater than the mode. Negative skewness indicates the opposite. Skewness is often used in data analysis to understand the shape and characteristics of a dataset.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The skewness is high, so the data is normal.","correct":"✓ The skewness is high, so the data is not normal.","note":"High skewness indicates that the data is not normally distributed.

It's a more advanced linguistic term. It describes a sound that begins as a stop (like 't' or 'd' where you briefly block the airflow) and then releases as a fricative (like 's' or 'z' where you create friction by forcing air through a narrow channel). Examples in English are the 'ch' sound in 'church' and the 'j' sound in 'judge'.

They exist in two isomeric forms, 1,2,3-triazole and 1,2,4-triazole, depending on the position of the nitrogen atoms. Triazole derivatives are important in medicine, particularly as antifungal agents (e.g., fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole) and in agriculture as fungicides. They are also used in dyes, photographic chemicals, and other industrial applications.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Triazole is used as antifungal.","correct":"✓ Triazoles are used as antifungals.","note":"Since we are talking about the class of compounds, the plural form 'triazoles' is more appropriate.

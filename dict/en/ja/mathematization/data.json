This often involves creating mathematical models, equations, or representations to analyze and understand the subject more rigorously. It's commonly used in fields like physics, economics, and engineering, but can also be applied to other areas like social sciences and even everyday problem-solving. The goal is to use mathematical tools to gain insights, make predictions, or solve problems in a systematic and precise way.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The mathematization is very important in the physics.","correct":"✓ Mathematization is very important in physics.","note":"'Mathematization' is an uncountable noun in this context, so it doesn't require the article 'the' before it.

Reflexive pronouns (myself, yourself, etc.) are used when the subject and object of a verb are the same. A non-reflexive verb, therefore, is one where the action is directed towards someone or something other than the subject. Understanding this term requires a solid grasp of grammatical concepts like verbs, pronouns, subjects, and objects.","note":"This term is primarily encountered in the context of grammatical analysis and language learning."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"'Kick' is a **non-reflexive** verb because you kick something other than yourself.","translation":"'Kick'は、自分自身以外の何かを蹴るので、非再帰動詞です。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"文法"},{"sentence":"The sentence 'She saw the bird' uses the verb 'see' in a **non-reflexive** way.","translation":"「彼女は鳥を見た」という文は、動詞「see」を非再帰的に使用しています。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"文法"},{"sentence":"To understand **non-reflexive** verb usage, it's essential to grasp the concept of direct objects.","translation":"非再帰動詞の用法を理解するには、直接目的語の概念を把握することが不可欠です。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"文法"}]}

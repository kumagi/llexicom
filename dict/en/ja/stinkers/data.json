It's not a very common word, and it's usually used in informal settings. The word comes from the verb 'to stink,' meaning to have a bad smell, so it implies that the people being described are morally or behaviorally offensive. It's a slightly stronger term than calling someone 'annoying' or 'unpleasant,' but not as harsh as calling them 'evil' or 'wicked.'"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The little stinkers hid my keys again!","translation":"あのいたずらっ子たちがまた私の鍵を隠した！","type":"noun","meaning_category":"嫌なやつら"},{"sentence":"Those stinkers are always trying to cheat people.","translation":"あのろくでなしどもはいつも人を騙そうとしている。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"ひどい人たち"}]}

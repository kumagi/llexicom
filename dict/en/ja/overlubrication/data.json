It's a compound word easily understood once its components ('over-' and 'lubrication') are known. The concept is relevant in engineering and maintenance contexts where proper lubrication is critical for machine performance and longevity. Understanding this term is important for those working with mechanical systems to avoid potential damage from excessive lubricant use."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"Proper maintenance includes preventing both underlubrication and **overlubrication**.","translation":"適切なメンテナンスには、潤滑不足と過剰潤滑の両方を防ぐことが含まれます。","type":"general","meaning_category":"general"},{"sentence":"**Overlubrication** of bearings can cause premature failure.","translation":"ベアリングの過剰潤滑は早期故障の原因となる可能性があります。","type":"technical","meaning_category":"technical"}]}

'Abandoned' comes from the verb 'abandon', which originates from the Old French 'abandoner', meaning 'to give up control of, to relinquish'. Ultimately, it traces back to the phrase 'à bandon' meaning 'under (one's) control, at (one's) disposal'. The adverb 'abandonedly' thus describes actions performed as if one has given up control or is in a state of being forsaken.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/əˈbændənədli/","syllables":"a-ban-don-ed-ly"},"inflection":{"notes":"Adverbs do not inflect."},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Abandonedly' describes actions done in a way that shows a lack of restraint, control, or concern for consequences. It often implies a state of emotional distress or a feeling of being forsaken, leading to reckless or unrestrained behavior.

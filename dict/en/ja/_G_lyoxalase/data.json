The glyoxalase system typically consists of two enzymes, Glyoxalase I and Glyoxalase II, that work sequentially. Glyoxalase I (lactoylglutathione lyase) catalyzes the conversion of methylglyoxal and glutathione to S-lactoylglutathione. Glyoxalase II (hydroxyacylglutathione hydrolase) then hydrolyzes S-lactoylglutathione to D-lactate and glutathione, regenerating glutathione for further detoxification.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Glyoxalasis is an enzyme.","correct":"✓ Glyoxalase is an enzyme.","note":"The correct singular form is 'glyoxalase', not 'glyoxalasis'."},{"incorrect":"✗ Glyoxalase are only one enzyme.","correct":"✓ Glyoxalases are a group of enzymes.","note":"Glyoxalase refers to a group or system of enzymes, not a single enzyme.

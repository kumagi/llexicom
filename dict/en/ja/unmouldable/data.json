It's formed by adding the prefix 'un-' to 'mouldable,' which means 'able to be shaped.' You might use 'unmouldable' to describe a material that has hardened and can no longer be molded, or to describe a person's beliefs that are so fixed they cannot be changed. Because it's not a common word, it's often better to use simpler alternatives like 'inflexible' or 'rigid.'"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The concrete had set, making it completely unmouldable.","translation":"コンクリートは固まっており、完全に成形不可能になっていた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"成形できない"},{"sentence":"His political views were so entrenched that they were virtually unmouldable.","translation":"彼の政治的見解は非常に根強く、事実上変えることができなかった。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"影響を受けない"},{"sentence":"The artist struggled with the unmouldable clay, unable to achieve the desired form.","translation":"アーティストは成形できない粘土と格闘し、望む形にすることができなかった。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"成形できない"}]}

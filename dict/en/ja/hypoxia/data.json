Hypoxia can happen for many reasons, like problems with breathing, blood circulation, or if tissues can't use oxygen properly. Because it's a medical term, you'll mostly find it in health-related articles or when talking about medical conditions.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The patient was diagnosed with hypoxia due to a respiratory infection.","translation":"患者は呼吸器感染症による低酸素症と診断された。","type":"medical","meaning_category":"oxygen deficiency"},{"sentence":"The study investigated the effects of hypoxia on brain function.","translation":"その研究は、低酸素症が脳機能に及ぼす影響を調査した。","type":"scientific","meaning_category":"oxygen deficiency"},{"sentence":"At high altitudes, the risk of hypoxia increases significantly.","translation":"高地では、低酸素症のリスクが大幅に増加する。","type":"environmental","meaning_category":"oxygen deficiency"},{"sentence":"The creative team was experiencing a hypoxia of ideas, struggling to come up with new concepts.","translation":"クリエイティブチームはアイデアの欠如を経験しており、新しいコンセプトを生み出すのに苦労していた。","type":"figurative","meaning_category":"lack of vitality"}]}

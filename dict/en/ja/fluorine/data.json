It is the lightest halogen and exists as a diatomic molecule (F₂) under standard conditions. It is extremely reactive and can form compounds with almost all other elements. Due to its reactivity, it is not found in its elemental form in nature but is present in various minerals. It is used in a wide range of applications, including the production of refrigerants, polymers (like Teflon), and in dental care (fluoride).","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Fluorine is a metal.","correct":"✓ Fluorine is a nonmetal.","note":"Fluorine is a halogen, which is a group of nonmetals."},{"incorrect":"✗ Fluorine is safe to inhale directly.","correct":"✓ Fluorine is a poisonous gas and dangerous to inhale.","note":"Fluorine is highly toxic and should not be inhaled."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["fluoride (フッ化物)","fluorocarbon (フッ化炭素)","hydrofluorocarbon (ハイドロフルオロカーボン)","fluoridation (フッ素添加)"],"phrasal_verbs":[],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"B2","frequency_google_ngram":"Relatively low frequency.","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Fluorine' refers to a chemical element. It's a pale yellow gas that's very reactive, meaning it easily combines with other substances. You'll often hear about it in the context of fluoride in toothpaste, which helps prevent tooth decay. It's also used in making things like Teflon, which is used in non-stick pans.

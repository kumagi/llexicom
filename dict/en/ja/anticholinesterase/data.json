This increased acetylcholine can enhance nerve impulse transmission. These substances can be reversible or irreversible. Reversible anticholinesterases are used therapeutically, while irreversible ones are often found in pesticides and nerve gases.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Anticholinesterase is a type of cholinesterase.","correct":"✓ Anticholinesterase inhibits cholinesterase.","note":"Anticholinesterase is an inhibitor of cholinesterase, not a type of it."},{"incorrect":"✗ Anticholinesterase increases the breakdown of acetylcholine.","correct":"✓ Anticholinesterase decreases the breakdown of acetylcholine.","note":"Anticholinesterase inhibits the enzyme that breaks down acetylcholine, thus decreasing its breakdown."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["anticholinesterase inhibitor"],"phrasal_verbs":[],"priority":"★★★"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"低頻度 (Low frequency) - 専門的な医学・科学用語。","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"\"Anticholinesterase\" is a technical term used in medicine and pharmacology. It refers to a class of chemicals that block the normal function of the enzyme cholinesterase. Cholinesterase's job is to break down acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter. By blocking cholinesterase, anticholinesterases increase the levels of acetylcholine in the body. These substances have various medical uses, but can also be toxic. Understanding this term requires some background knowledge in biology and chemistry.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The doctor prescribed an **anticholinesterase** to treat her myasthenia gravis.","translation":"医師は彼女の重症筋無力症を治療するために抗コリンエステラーゼを処方した。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"medication"},{"sentence":"Organophosphate pesticides act as irreversible **anticholinesterases**.","translation":"有機リン系殺虫剤は、不可逆的な抗コリンエステラーゼとして作用する。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"toxicology"},{"sentence":"**Anticholinesterase** drugs can improve cognitive function in some patients with Alzheimer's disease.","translation":"抗コリンエステラーゼ薬は、アルツハイマー病の一部の患者の認知機能を改善することができる。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"pharmacology"}]}

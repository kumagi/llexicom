It describes a state of being partially neutral, meaning not fully committed to either side of a conflict or issue. Understanding the prefix \"semi-\" (meaning \"half\" or \"partially\") is key to grasping the word's meaning. It is more nuanced than simply \"neutral\" and implies a more complex or qualified position. Due to its specific usage and relatively low frequency, it is more likely to be encountered by advanced learners or those studying related fields."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"Switzerland maintained a semineutral position during the early years of World War II.","translation":"スイスは第二次世界大戦の初期に準中立の立場を維持した。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"Partially neutral"},{"sentence":"The mediator proposed a semineutral agreement that favored neither party completely.","translation":"調停者は、どちらの当事者も完全に支持しない準中立的な合意を提案した。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"Partially neutral"},{"sentence":"The company adopted a semineutral policy regarding employee political activities.","translation":"会社は、従業員の政治活動に関して準中立的な方針を採用した。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"Partially neutral"}]}

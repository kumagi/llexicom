It is often used in formal contexts such as law, science, and official reports. For example, if a contract is 'invalidated,' it means that it is no longer legally enforceable. Similarly, if scientific data is 'invalidated,' it means that it is no longer considered reliable or accurate. The word implies a formal process or a significant reason for the loss of validity, so it is not typically used in everyday conversation. It's important to distinguish 'invalidated' from 'invalid,' which can mean sick or disabled (when referring to a person)."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The judge invalidated the search warrant due to lack of probable cause.","translation":"裁判官は、相当な理由の欠如を理由に捜索令状を無効にした。","type":"verb (past participle)","meaning_category":"無効にされた (legal)"},{"sentence":"The software glitch invalidated the data collected during the experiment.","translation":"ソフトウェアの不具合により、実験中に収集されたデータが無効になった。","type":"verb (past participle)","meaning_category":"正当性を失った (scientific)"},{"sentence":"The invalidated parking ticket was thrown away.","translation":"無効にされた駐車違反切符は捨てられた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"無効にされた (general)"},{"sentence":"The new evidence invalidated his previous claims.","translation":"新しい証拠は、彼の以前の主張を無効にした。","type":"verb (past participle)","meaning_category":"無効にされた (general)"}]}

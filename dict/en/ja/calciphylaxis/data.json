It is derived from the Greek words 'calci-' (calcium), 'phylax' (protection), and '-is' (a process or condition). Selye originally used the term to describe a systemic hypersensitivity reaction in which tissues become sensitized to calcification following exposure to certain sensitizing agents.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/ˌkæl.sɪ.fɪˈlæk.sɪs/","syllables":"cal-ci-phy-lax-is"},"inflection":{"noun_plural":"calciphylaxes"},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"Calciphylaxis is a rare and life-threatening condition primarily affecting individuals with end-stage renal disease undergoing dialysis. It involves the deposition of calcium in small blood vessels, leading to painful skin lesions, tissue necrosis, and a high risk of infection. Diagnosis is often challenging and requires a skin biopsy. Treatment options are limited and focus on managing pain, preventing infection, and addressing underlying factors such as hyperparathyroidism.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Calciphylaxis is a common skin condition.","correct":"✓ Calciphylaxis is a rare skin condition.","note":"Calciphylaxis is a rare disease, not a common one."},{"incorrect":"✗ Calciphylaxis is easily treated with antibiotics.","correct":"✓ Calciphylaxis treatment is complex and involves multiple approaches, including pain management and addressing underlying causes.","note":"Antibiotics are only used to treat secondary infections.

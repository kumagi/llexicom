The comparative form 'truer' simply indicates a greater degree of truth, accuracy, or faithfulness.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/ˈtruːər/","syllables":"tru-er (2 syllables)"},"inflection":{"adjective_forms":{"base":"true","comparative":"truer","superlative":"truest"}},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Truer' is used to compare two things, indicating that one is more aligned with reality, more genuine, or more loyal than the other. It is not as commonly used as 'true' or 'truest', but it is appropriate when making a direct comparison. It's important to ensure that the context clearly establishes what is being compared.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ This is the truer fact.","correct":"✓ This is the truer statement. / ✓ This is a truer fact.","note":"'Fact' is often considered absolute.

Consider rephrasing to emphasize accuracy or representation rather than the fact itself."},{"incorrect":"✗ She is truer than him.","correct":"✓ She is truer to him than anyone else. / ✓ She is more loyal than him.","note":"When comparing loyalty, it's often clearer to specify *to whom* someone is truer.

This is achieved by blocking or filtering out non-parallel rays or particles. Collimators are used in a variety of applications, including lasers, telescopes, X-ray machines, and particle accelerators. The effectiveness of a collimator is determined by its ability to produce a highly parallel beam, which is often measured by the beam divergence.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The colimator was broken.","correct":"✓ The collimator was broken.","note":"Common misspelling.

It's not a common word in everyday conversation, so it's more likely to appear in formal writing or when someone wants to emphasize the positive nature of something. For example, a critic might \"glowingly review\" a movie, meaning they gave it a very positive review. Because of its less frequent use and more nuanced meaning, it's considered a higher-level vocabulary word."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The candles burned glowingly, creating a romantic atmosphere.","translation":"ろうそくが輝くように燃え、ロマンチックな雰囲気を作り出した。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"Shining brightly"},{"sentence":"The CEO spoke glowingly about the company's future prospects.","translation":"CEOは会社の将来の見通しについて熱烈に語った。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"Expressing great praise"},{"sentence":"Her artwork was glowingly praised by the art community.","translation":"彼女の作品は美術界から絶賛された。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"Receiving enthusiastic praise"},{"sentence":"The sunset painted the sky glowingly with vibrant colors.","translation":"夕焼けは空を鮮やかな色彩で輝くように染めた。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"Shining brightly"},{"sentence":"He remembered her glowingly, always smiling and full of life.","translation":"彼は彼女のことをいつも笑顔で生き生きとしていたと、熱烈に思い出した。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"Remembering with fondness"}]}

You would use 'politenesses' when you are talking about specific examples or instances of polite behavior. It's not as common as just saying 'politeness' in general. For example, instead of saying 'He showed great politenesses,' you would usually say 'He showed great politeness.' But if you were listing specific polite actions, you might use 'politenesses,' like 'She responded with a series of small politenesses, such as thanking everyone individually and offering them refreshments.'"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The exchange was marked by a series of formal politenesses.","translation":"そのやり取りは一連の形式的な礼儀作法によって特徴づけられた。","type":"noun (plural)","meaning_category":"丁寧さ、礼儀正しさ"},{"sentence":"Despite their disagreement, they observed all the usual politenesses.","translation":"彼らの意見の相違にもかかわらず、彼らは通常の礼儀作法をすべて守った。","type":"noun (plural)","meaning_category":"丁寧さ、礼儀正しさ"},{"sentence":"He acknowledged her help with a few simple politenesses.","translation":"彼はいくつかの簡単な礼儀作法で彼女の助けに感謝した。","type":"noun (plural)","meaning_category":"丁寧さ、礼儀正しさ"}]}

It's a complex idea often explored in philosophy, physics (like wave-particle duality), and psychology. Think of examples like good vs. evil, light vs. darkness, mind vs. body.  It doesn’t necessarily mean these things are *fighting* each other; they can be seen as complementary parts of a whole. The concept emphasizes the interconnectedness of opposites and how understanding one requires understanding its counterpart."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The concept of **duality** is central to many Eastern philosophies.","translation":"二元論の概念は、多くの東洋哲学の中心的な考え方です。","type":"philosophical context","meaning_category":"opposing forces in philosophy"},{"sentence":"Wave-particle **duality** is a fundamental principle of quantum mechanics.","translation":"波動と粒子の二重性は、量子力学の基本的な原理です。","type":"scientific context","meaning_category":"opposing natures in physics"},{"sentence":"She experienced a **duality** of emotions – joy and sadness at the same time.","translation":"彼女は相反する感情、つまり喜びと悲しみを同時に経験しました。","type":"psychological context","meaning_category":"opposing feelings"},{"sentence":"The novel explores the **duality** of human nature, showing both its capacity for good and evil.","translation":"その小説は、人間の二面性を探求し、善と悪の両方の可能性を示しています。","type":"literary context","meaning_category":"opposing traits in humans"},{"sentence":"There is a **duality** between his public persona and his private life.","translation":"彼の公の顔と私生活の間には二元性があります。","type":"social context","meaning_category":"opposing appearances/realities"}]}

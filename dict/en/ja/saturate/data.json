Think of a sponge being filled with water – once it’s full, it’s saturated.  It's often used literally (like saturating fabric with liquid) but also figuratively, meaning to be completely filled with something like an emotion or influence. For example, the market could be 'saturated' with similar products, or a news report might say a city is 'saturated' with crime."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The soil was **saturated** after days of heavy rain.","translation":"何日も降り続いた雨の後、土は飽和状態だった。","type":"verb (past tense)","meaning_category":"文字通りの意味: 液体で満たす"},{"sentence":"The market is **saturated** with cheap imitations.","translation":"市場は安価な模倣品で飽和状態だ。","type":"verb (past participle)","meaning_category":"比喩的な意味: 満たす、いっぱいにする"},{"sentence":"The colours in the painting were incredibly **saturated**.","translation":"その絵の色彩は非常に鮮やかだった。","type":"verb (past participle - describing quality)","meaning_category":"濃い、鮮やかな（色など）"},{"sentence":"The sponge is completely **saturated** with water.","translation":"そのスポンジは水で完全に飽和している。","type":"verb (present participle)","meaning_category":"文字通りの意味: 液体で満たす"},{"sentence":"The air was **saturated** with humidity.","translation":"空気は湿度でいっぱいだった。","type":"verb (past tense)","meaning_category":"満たされている（空気など）"}]}

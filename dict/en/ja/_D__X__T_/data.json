These formats are lossy, meaning some data is lost during compression, but they significantly reduce the memory footprint of textures, which is crucial for performance in graphics applications. Different DXT formats (e.g., DXT1, DXT3, DXT5) offer varying levels of compression and support for alpha channels.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{},"related_words":{"derivatives":["DirectX","texture compression","S3 Texture Compression (S3TC)"],"phrasal_verbs":[]},"level_frequency":{},"readability_explanation":{"level":"Advanced","text":"DXT is a technical term used in computer graphics related to texture compression. It's primarily relevant to game developers, graphics programmers, and those working with DirectX or other graphics APIs.

It describes satellites that do not maintain a fixed position relative to the Earth's surface.

Non-geosynchronous satellites are often used for specific applications like Earth observation or communication in areas where geosynchronous satellites have limitations.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The satellite is non geosynchronous.","correct":"✓ The satellite is non-geosynchronous.","note":"The hyphen is important for clarity and correctness."},{"incorrect":"✗ Non-geosynchronous satellites are better than geosynchronous satellites.","correct":"✓ Non-geosynchronous satellites are suitable for different purposes than geosynchronous satellites.","note":"Neither type of satellite is inherently 'better.'

It describes an orbit that is not geosynchronous, meaning that a satellite in such an orbit does not remain fixed over a single point on Earth. The term is relatively uncommon in general language and is more likely to be encountered in specialized texts or discussions. Understanding the term requires familiarity with basic concepts of orbital mechanics.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The company launched a constellation of non-geosynchronous satellites for global internet access.","translation":"その会社は、グローバルインターネットアクセスを提供するために、非静止軌道衛星のコンステレーションを打ち上げました。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"satellite orbit"},{"sentence":"Non-geosynchronous orbits allow for coverage of the Earth's polar regions, which is not possible with geostationary satellites.","translation":"非静止軌道は、静止衛星では不可能な地球の極地域をカバーできます。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"satellite orbit"}]}

This concept is particularly important in computer science, especially in functional programming and data structures, where ensuring that data remains constant can prevent errors and simplify debugging. It is also used in philosophical and scientific contexts to describe things that are considered unchanging or constant.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The nonmutability is important.","correct":"✓ Nonmutability is important.","note":"The article 'the' is generally not used before nonmutability when referring to the general concept."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["mutable (形容詞: 可変の)","immutable (形容詞: 不変の)"],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Nonmutability' is a technical term, primarily used in computer science and philosophy, referring to the inability of something to be changed after its creation. It's the opposite of 'mutability,' which means 'able to be changed.' Understanding this term is useful when discussing programming paradigms like functional programming or philosophical concepts related to permanence and change.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The **nonmutability** of strings in Python ensures that their values remain consistent throughout the program.","translation":"Pythonにおける文字列の不変性は、プログラム全体でそれらの値が一貫性を保つことを保証します。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"不変性 (プログラミング)"},{"sentence":"Philosophers often debate the **nonmutability** of certain moral principles.","translation":"哲学者たちは、特定の道徳原則の不変性についてしばしば議論します。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"不変性 (哲学)"}]}

Enzymes are the most well-known type, but whole cells or microorganisms can also act as biocatalysts. They are used in various industrial applications, including the production of pharmaceuticals, food, and biofuels, due to their high specificity and efficiency. They often operate under milder conditions (temperature, pH) than traditional chemical catalysts, making them more environmentally friendly.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Biocatalysts are only used in living organisms.","correct":"✓ Biocatalysts are used in both living organisms and industrial processes.","note":"Biocatalysts function in both living systems and industrial applications."},{"incorrect":"✗ Biocatalysts are the same as chemical catalysts.","correct":"✓ Biocatalysts are biological substances, while chemical catalysts are synthetic chemicals.","note":"Biocatalysts are biological in origin, unlike chemical catalysts."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["biocatalysis","biocatalytic"],"phrasal_verbs":[],"priority":"★★★"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C1","frequency_google_ngram":"Relatively low frequency, primarily used in scientific and technical contexts.","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Biocatalyst' is a technical term used in biology, chemistry, and biotechnology.

It can describe a lack of interest or excitement, as well as a lack of sharpness or clarity. It is often used in a negative context to express dissatisfaction with something that is boring, monotonous, or unclear. While 'dullness' is a valid word, it is less commonly used in modern English compared to its adjective form 'dull'.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The dulness of the movie was very high.","correct":"✓ The dulness of the movie was very noticeable.","note":"'Dulness' is a quality, not a quantity, so it cannot be 'high' or 'low'.

'Dull' itself can mean boring, or not sharp. So 'dulness' can refer to the quality of being boring (like a dull lecture) or the quality of not being sharp (like a dull knife). It's not a very common word, and you'll more often see the adjective 'dull' used instead. Because it's not common, it's considered a more advanced word.","priority":"★☆☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The **dulness** of the exhibit failed to attract many visitors.","translation":"展示の退屈さは、多くの訪問者を引き付けることができなかった。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"退屈さ"},{"sentence":"The **dulness** of the blade made carving the wood a slow process.","translation":"刃の鈍さのために、木を彫る作業は遅々として進まなかった。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"鈍さ"},{"sentence":"She tried to ignore the **dulness** that had settled over her life.","translation":"彼女は自分の人生に漂う退屈さを無視しようとした。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"単調さ"},{"sentence":"The **dulness** of the color palette gave the painting a somber mood.","translation":"色彩のくすみが、絵に陰鬱な雰囲気を与えた。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"不明瞭さ"}]}

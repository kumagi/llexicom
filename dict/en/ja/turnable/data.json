It means 'able to be turned'. It can be used as an adjective to describe something that can be rotated, or as a noun to refer to something that is designed to be turned. However, it is not a very common word, and there are often more common and natural-sounding alternatives, such as 'rotatable' or 'swiveling' for the adjective, and 'knob' or 'dial' for the noun. Therefore, it is best to use 'turnable' when it is the most precise and appropriate word, but to be aware of the alternatives.","priority":"★☆☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The telescope has a turnable mount for easy viewing of the night sky.","translation":"その望遠鏡には、夜空を簡単に見るための回転可能なマウントが付いています。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"回転できる"},{"sentence":"The potter used a turnable to shape the clay.","translation":"陶芸家は、粘土を成形するために回転台を使いました。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"回転するもの"}]}

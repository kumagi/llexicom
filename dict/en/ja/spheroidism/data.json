This microstructure is often desirable because it improves the material's ductility and toughness. The process of achieving this microstructure is called spheroidization.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The spheroidism of the material made it brittle.","correct":"✓ The spheroidism of the material made it more ductile.","note":"Spheroidism generally improves ductility, not brittleness."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["spheroid","spheroidal","spheroidize","spheroidization"],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Very low frequency - technical term.","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Spheroidism' is a technical term used in materials science and metallurgy.

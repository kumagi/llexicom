Therefore, \"demonize\" means to portray someone or something as evil or demonic, and \"demonization\" is the process or act of doing so.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/ˌdiːmənaɪˈzeɪʃən/","syllables":"de-mon-i-za-tion"},"inflection":{"noun_plural":"demonizations"},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"\"Demonization\" refers to the process of portraying someone or something as evil, wicked, or demonic.

It means that the satellite stays above the same point on Earth because it orbits at the same rate that the Earth rotates. This is useful for things like communication satellites and weather satellites, where you want the satellite to always be in the same position in the sky. It's a more precise term than 'geosynchronous,' which just means the satellite's orbital period matches the Earth's rotation, but doesn't necessarily mean it's over the equator."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The geostationary weather satellite provides continuous images of the hurricane.","translation":"その静止気象衛星は、ハリケーンの連続画像を配信しています。","type":"example","meaning_category":"General usage"},{"sentence":"A geostationary orbit is located approximately 36,000 kilometers above the Earth's equator.","translation":"静止軌道は、地球の赤道上空約36,000キロメートルに位置しています。","type":"example","meaning_category":"Technical description"},{"sentence":"Geostationary communication satellites are essential for global television broadcasting.","translation":"静止通信衛星は、グローバルなテレビ放送に不可欠です。","type":"example","meaning_category":"Application"}]}

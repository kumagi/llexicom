It means that the crystals in the rock are so small that it's difficult to see them clearly, even with a microscope.

Because it's a specialized term, it's not commonly used outside of geology.","priority":"★☆☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"Under the microscope, the basalt showed a dubiocrystalline matrix with larger phenocrysts.","translation":"顕微鏡下では、玄武岩はより大きな斑晶を持つ判別困難な結晶質の基質を示した。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"岩石組織"},{"sentence":"The fine-grained texture is described as dubiocrystalline due to the minute size of the crystals.","translation":"その微粒組織は、結晶の微細なサイズのために、判別困難な結晶質と記述される。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"岩石組織"}]}

It's formed from the adjective 'squatty,' which means short and thick, and the adverbial suffix '-ly.' Because it's not frequently used, it's more likely to be encountered in descriptive writing where the author seeks to convey a specific visual image of something being short and wide. Understanding the root word 'squat' helps in deciphering its meaning."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The old armchair sat squattily in the corner of the room.","translation":"古い肘掛け椅子は部屋の隅にどっしりと置かれていた。","type":"general","meaning_category":"manner of sitting"},{"sentence":"The little cottage was built squattily, hugging the hillside.","translation":"その小さなコテージは丘の斜面に寄り添うように、どっしりと建てられていた。","type":"general","meaning_category":"manner of building"}]}

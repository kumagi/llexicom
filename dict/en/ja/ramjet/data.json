They rely on the aircraft's forward motion to compress incoming air, making them simpler in design than turbojets. However, they require an external means of propulsion to reach a speed where they can operate efficiently.

It is simpler than other jet engines because it has no moving parts to compress the air. However, it only works well at high speeds, usually faster than the speed of sound. A **scramjet** is a similar engine designed for even faster speeds. These engines are often used in missiles and experimental aircraft."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The missile was powered by a **ramjet** engine, allowing it to reach supersonic speeds.","translation":"そのミサイルはラムジェットエンジンを搭載しており、超音速に達することができた。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"engine"},{"sentence":"Engineers are developing new **ramjet** technologies for hypersonic flight.","translation":"エンジニアたちは極超音速飛行のための新しいラムジェット技術を開発している。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"engine"}]}

It indicates that a material has been chemically altered by incorporating siloxane groups, which are chains of silicon and oxygen atoms. This modification is often done to improve specific properties of the material, such as its resistance to water or weathering. Understanding this term requires a background in chemistry or materials science."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The siloxane-modified epoxy resin showed improved adhesion to metal surfaces.","translation":"シロキサン変性エポキシ樹脂は、金属表面への接着性が向上しました。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"chemical property"},{"sentence":"We developed a new siloxane-modified polyurethane coating for automotive applications.","translation":"自動車用途向けの新しいシロキサン変性ポリウレタンコーティングを開発しました。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"material science"}]}

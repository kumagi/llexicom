In chemistry, aromaticity is a special property of cyclic, planar molecules with delocalized pi electrons, leading to enhanced stability. Non-aromatic compounds lack this property.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ This perfume is non aromatic.","correct":"✓ This perfume is non-aromatic.","note":"Correct spelling is crucial.

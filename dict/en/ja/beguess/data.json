It means to arrive at a conclusion or supposition about something without sufficient evidence. It is not a word frequently used in everyday conversation or writing, and its usage often implies a degree of uncertainty or speculation. While 'guess' is perfectly acceptable in most contexts, 'beguess' might be chosen to add a more sophisticated or literary tone to the writing."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"I can only **beguess** at her reasons for leaving.","translation":"彼女が去った理由を推測することしかできません。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"推測する"},{"sentence":"Let us **beguess** what the future holds.","translation":"未来がどうなるか推測してみましょう。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"推測する"}]}

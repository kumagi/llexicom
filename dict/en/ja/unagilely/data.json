It is formed by adding the prefix 'un-' to 'agilely', which means 'in an agile manner.' Therefore, 'unagilely' means 'in a not agile manner' or 'clumsily.' It is used to describe movements that lack grace, dexterity, or nimbleness. Because of its rarity and the more common alternatives like 'clumsily' or 'awkwardly,' it is more likely to be encountered in advanced or technical writing."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The bear, normally a creature of the forest, moved unagilely on the city streets.","translation":"普段は森の生き物である熊は、街の通りを不器用に移動した。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"clumsily"},{"sentence":"Due to the heavy armor, the knight moved unagilely and slowly.","translation":"重い鎧のせいで、騎士は不器用にゆっくりと動いた。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"awkwardly"}]}

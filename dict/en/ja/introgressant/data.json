'Introgression' itself is formed from 'intro-' (meaning 'inward') + 'gress' (from Latin 'gressus', past participle of 'gradi' meaning 'to step or walk') + '-ion'.

It describes an organism or population that is actively involved in the process of introgression, which is the movement of genes from one species into the gene pool of another through hybridization and backcrossing. Understanding the term requires familiarity with concepts like gene flow, hybridization, and evolutionary processes.

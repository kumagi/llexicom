It implies a degree of inexactness but also suggests a reasonable closeness to the actual value. It's commonly used in mathematics, science, and engineering when dealing with complex calculations or measurements. The term can also describe something that resembles or approaches a certain quality or standard.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"The approximating answer is exactly 10.","correct":"The approximate answer is close to 10.","note":"'Approximating' implies a degree of inexactness.

It's used when you don't have an exact number or value, but you have something that's close. For example, if you're guessing how many people are in a room, you might say 'I'm approximating 50 people.' It's also used when something is similar to something else, but not exactly the same. This word is often used in math, science, and engineering.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The final cost of the renovations is still unknown, but we are approximating it to be around $50,000.","translation":"改修の最終的な費用はまだ不明ですが、約5万ドルと概算しています。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"概算する"},{"sentence":"The shape of the object is approximating a sphere.","translation":"その物体の形状は球面に近似している。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"近似する"},{"sentence":"This is just an approximating calculation; the actual value may vary.","translation":"これは単なる概算であり、実際の値は異なる場合があります。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"近似的な"}]}

Afocal systems are often used as attachments to other optical devices, such as cameras or telescopes, to change the magnification without introducing a focus shift.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The image was afocal, so I couldn't see anything.","correct":"✓ The image was out of focus, so I couldn't see anything.","note":"\"Afocal\" describes the system, not the image.

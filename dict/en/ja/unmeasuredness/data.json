It is typically used in formal or literary contexts to describe something that is vast, boundless, or beyond human comprehension. Due to its infrequent usage and abstract nature, it is considered a high-level vocabulary word. More common synonyms such as \"vastness\" or \"immensity\" are often preferred in everyday language."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The poet tried to capture the unmeasuredness of human emotion in his verse.","translation":"詩人は、人間の感情の計り知れなさを詩に表現しようとした。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"広大さ、計り知れなさ"},{"sentence":"The sheer unmeasuredness of the task ahead was daunting.","translation":"目の前の仕事の途方もない広大さは、気が遠くなるほどだった。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"広大さ、計り知れなさ"}]}

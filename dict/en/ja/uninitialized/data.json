The content of an uninitialized variable is often unpredictable and can lead to bugs if not handled carefully. It's a common practice to initialize variables with a default value (e.g., 0 for integers, null for objects) when they are declared to avoid such issues.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The program crashed because of a uninitialize variable.","correct":"✓ The program crashed because of an uninitialized variable.","note":"Use 'an' before 'uninitialized' because it starts with a vowel sound."},{"incorrect":"✗ The variable is uninitialize.","correct":"✓ The variable is uninitialized.","note":"'Uninitialized' is the correct adjective form.

It describes a situation where a variable or a piece of data in a program has been created but hasn't been given a specific starting value. This can cause problems because the variable might contain random or unexpected data, leading to errors. Programmers usually make sure to 'initialize' variables, meaning they give them a starting value, to prevent these kinds of issues. Understanding this term is important for anyone working with computer code.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The compiler warned about the use of an **uninitialized** local variable.","translation":"コンパイラは、初期化されていないローカル変数の使用について警告しました。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"初期化されていない"},{"sentence":"Debugging the code revealed that the error was due to accessing **uninitialized** memory.","translation":"コードをデバッグした結果、エラーの原因は初期化されていないメモリへのアクセスであることが判明しました。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"初期化されていない"},{"sentence":"Failing to initialize the array resulted in unpredictable values being stored in the **uninitialized** elements.","translation":"配列の初期化に失敗したため、初期化されていない要素に予測できない値が格納されました。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"初期化されていない"}]}

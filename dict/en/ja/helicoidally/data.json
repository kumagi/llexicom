It's not commonly used in everyday language, but it may appear in scientific or technical writing. To understand it, you need to know that a helix is a three-dimensional curve that winds around a central axis, like a spiral staircase. So, if something is described as 'helicoidally' arranged, it means it's arranged in that spiral shape."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The metal shavings came off the lathe helicoidally.","translation":"金属の削りくずは旋盤から螺旋状に剥がれ落ちた。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"螺旋状に"},{"sentence":"The climbing plant entwined helicoidally up the trellis.","translation":"そのつる植物は螺旋状に格子垣をよじ登った。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"螺旋状に"},{"sentence":"The protein molecule folded helicoidally into its functional shape.","translation":"そのタンパク質分子は螺旋状に折り畳まれて機能的な形になった。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"螺旋状に"}]}

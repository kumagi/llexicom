Because of its rarity and specific meaning, it is unlikely to be encountered in everyday conversation or writing. It is more likely to appear in literary or descriptive contexts where the author wishes to emphasize the intensity of crying or noise.","priority":"★☆☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The two toddlers outbawled each other in a battle for attention.","translation":"二人の幼児は、注目を集めるために互いに相手より大声で泣き叫んだ。","type":"verb (vi)","meaning_category":"大声で泣く"},{"sentence":"She tried to outbawl the crying baby, but it was impossible.","translation":"彼女は泣いている赤ちゃんより大声で泣こうとしたが、不可能だった。","type":"verb (vt)","meaning_category":"泣き負かす"}]}

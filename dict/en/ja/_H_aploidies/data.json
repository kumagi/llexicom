The haploid state describes a cell or organism that has a single set of chromosomes, as opposed to the diploid state, which has two sets. This term is primarily encountered in scientific literature and advanced biology courses. Understanding requires knowledge of basic genetics concepts such as chromosomes, ploidy, and cell division. The plural form 'haploidies' is used when discussing multiple cases or examples of haploidy.

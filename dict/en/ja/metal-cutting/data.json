'Metal' refers to a typically hard, shiny, malleable, fusible, and ductile substance, such as iron, gold, silver, copper, or aluminum. 'Cutting' refers to the action of using a tool to divide or separate something. Therefore, 'metal-cutting' literally means the action of dividing or separating metal using a tool.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/ˈmɛtəlˌkʌtɪŋ/","syllables":"met-al-cut-ting"},"inflection":{"notes":"This word can function as both an adjective and a noun. As an adjective, it does not inflect. As a noun, it is typically used in the singular form to refer to the general process or activity."},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Metal-cutting' is primarily used in two ways: as an adjective to describe tools, equipment, or processes specifically designed for cutting metal, and as a noun to refer to the act or process of cutting metal. When used as an adjective, it often precedes the noun it modifies (e.g., 'metal-cutting tools'). When used as a noun, it typically refers to the general activity rather than a specific instance.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ metal cutting tool","correct":"✓ metal-cutting tool","note":"When used as an adjective before a noun, it is generally hyphenated."},{"incorrect":"✗ metal cuting","correct":"✓ metal-cutting","note":"The correct spelling is 'metal-cutting' with two 't's."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["cut (verb, noun)","cutter (noun)","cutting (verb, noun, adjective)","metalworking (noun)","machining (noun)"],"phrasal_verbs":[],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"B2","frequency_google_ngram":"Relatively low frequency, but common in technical and industrial contexts.","priority":"★★☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"B2","text":"The term 'metal-cutting' is a compound word commonly used in technical and industrial settings to describe the process or tools used for cutting metal.

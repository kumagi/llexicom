'Complimentary' comes from the word 'compliment,' originally meaning to fulfill or complete, later evolving to mean a polite expression of praise or respect. In the context of free items, it implies something given as a courtesy. In real estate, 'comparables' is a shortened version of 'comparable properties'.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/kɑmps/","syllables":"comps"},"inflection":{"notes":"Plural noun."},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"The word 'comps' has two main meanings. The first, and perhaps more common, is as a slang term for 'complimentary' items or services, meaning things given for free. This is often used in the context of entertainment (free tickets) or hospitality (free hotel services). The second meaning is specific to the real estate industry, where it is an abbreviation for 'comparable properties'. These are properties similar to the one being evaluated, and their recent sales prices are used to estimate the value of the property in question. Context is crucial to understanding which meaning is intended.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ I used comps to fix my computer.","correct":"✓ I used computer components to fix my computer.","note":"'Comps' (complimentary items) is unrelated to 'components' (parts of a machine)."},{"incorrect":"✗ The comps were very complimenting.","correct":"✓ The comps were very similar.","note":"'Comps' (comparable properties) should not be confused with 'complimenting' (expressing praise)."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["comparable (adjective)","complimentary (adjective)"],"phrasal_verbs":[],"priority":"★☆☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"B2 (in specific contexts)","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency (relatively uncommon outside specific contexts)","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"B2","text":"The word 'comps' is a shortened form of two different words, depending on the context.

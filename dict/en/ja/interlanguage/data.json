It is not simply a deficient version of the target language, but a system with its own internal consistency and rules. Interlanguage is influenced by the learner's first language (L1), the target language (L2), and universal language principles. It is a dynamic system that changes as the learner progresses, but it can also 'fossilize,' meaning that certain errors become persistent. The concept of interlanguage is central to second language acquisition research.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ He speaks interlanguage fluently.","correct":"✓ He uses interlanguage effectively. / ✓ His interlanguage is developing well.","note":"'Interlanguage' is a system, not a language itself that one can speak fluently.

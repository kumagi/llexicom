'Object' comes from Latin 'obiectus', past participle of 'obicere' (to throw before, set against), from 'ob-' (against) + 'iacere' (to throw). The suffix '-ize' means 'to make, to treat as'. Therefore, 'objectize' means 'to make into an object' or 'to treat as an object'.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/ˈɒbdʒɛktaɪzd/","syllables":"ob-jec-tized"},"inflection":{"notes":"This is the past participle form of the verb 'objectize' and can also function as an adjective."},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Objectized' typically refers to the act of treating a person or thing as an object, often stripping them of their individuality, agency, or inherent worth.

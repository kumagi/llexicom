Opsonins are antibodies or complement proteins that enhance phagocytosis by marking the particle for destruction by phagocytes (e.g., macrophages, neutrophils). This process is crucial for the immune system to clear pathogens effectively.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[],"priority":"★☆☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["opsonin","opsonization","opsonize"],"priority":"★★★"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Very low frequency","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C2","text":"The term 'opsonized' is a highly specialized term used in immunology and microbiology.

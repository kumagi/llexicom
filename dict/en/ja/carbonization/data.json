This is typically achieved through heating the material in the absence of oxygen. It is used in various contexts, including the production of charcoal and coke, as well as in the study of fossil fuels. In pathology, it describes the charring of tissue due to severe burns.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The process of carbonization is to add carbon to a substance.","correct":"✓ The process of carbonization is to remove other elements from a substance, leaving mostly carbon.","note":"Carbonization involves removing elements other than carbon, not adding carbon."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["carbonize (verb)","carbonized (adjective)","carbon (noun)"],"phrases":["carbon dating (炭素年代測定)"],"priority":"★★★"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C1","frequency_google_ngram":"relatively low","priority":"★★☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Carbonization' is a technical term used in chemistry, materials science, and pathology.

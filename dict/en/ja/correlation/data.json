It's important to remember that correlation does not imply causation. Just because two things are correlated doesn't mean that one causes the other. There might be a third, unobserved variable influencing both, or the relationship might be purely coincidental. The strength of a correlation is measured by the correlation coefficient, which ranges from -1 to +1. A positive correlation (close to +1) indicates that as one variable increases, the other tends to increase as well. A negative correlation (close to -1) indicates that as one variable increases, the other tends to decrease. A correlation close to 0 indicates a weak or no linear relationship.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The correlation causes the disease.","correct":"✓ The correlation does not prove causation.","note":"Correlation does not equal causation.

It's commonly used in statistics, research, and academic writing to explain how variables are related to each other. It's important to understand that just because two things are correlated doesn't mean one causes the other. This is a key concept in understanding research findings. The strength and direction of a correlation are often measured using a correlation coefficient, which is a number between -1 and +1. A positive correlation means that as one thing increases, the other tends to increase as well. A negative correlation means that as one thing increases, the other tends to decrease.

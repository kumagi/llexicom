The interconversion typically involves the migration of a hydrogen atom or proton, accompanied by a change in a single bond and an adjacent double bond. The different forms are called tautomers. Tautomers are different structural isomers that are in dynamic equilibrium.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Tautomerism is the same as resonance.","correct":"✓ Tautomerism is different from resonance.","note":"Tautomerism involves the movement of atoms (usually hydrogen), while resonance involves the delocalization of electrons."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["tautomer (noun: 互変異性体)","tautomeric (adjective: 互変異性の)"],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Tautomerism' is a specialized term in chemistry referring to the ability of certain chemical compounds to exist in two or more forms that can easily convert into one another.

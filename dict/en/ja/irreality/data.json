It is often used in discussions of dreams, art, or situations that feel detached from everyday life. Because it is not a frequently used word, it is more common to encounter 'unreality' which carries a similar meaning. Understanding the prefix 'ir-' as a negating element is helpful in deciphering the word's meaning.

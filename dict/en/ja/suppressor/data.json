It's commonly found in technical and specialized contexts. For example, in medicine, an 'immune suppressor' reduces the activity of the immune system. In firearms, a 'suppressor' (also known as a silencer) reduces the noise of the gun. The meaning is generally consistent across different fields, but understanding the specific context is important to grasp the intended meaning.

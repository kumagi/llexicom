It's important to note that \"water-resistance\" is different from \"waterproof.\" Waterproof items are designed to be completely impervious to water, even when submerged for a certain period. Water-resistant items, on the other hand, can withstand some exposure to water, such as light rain or splashes, but are not designed for prolonged submersion. The level of water-resistance is often indicated by a rating, such as an IP (Ingress Protection) rating or an ATM (atmospheres) rating for watches.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ This watch is water-resistance, so I can swim with it.","correct":"✓ This watch is water-resistant, but I still shouldn't swim with it for extended periods.","note":"Water-resistance doesn't mean waterproof.

Think of a jacket that keeps you dry in light rain. It's water-resistant. But if you go swimming with it, water will eventually get in. This is different from \"waterproof,\" which means that water can't get in at all, even if you put it underwater for a long time. So, water-resistance is good for light rain or splashes, but not for swimming or being underwater for a long time.","priority":"★★★"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The new smartphone is advertised as having improved **water-resistance**.","translation":"その新しいスマートフォンは、耐水性が向上したと宣伝されています。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"耐水性"},{"sentence":"This **water-resistance** spray can protect your shoes from rain.","translation":"この耐水スプレーは、あなたの靴を雨から守ることができます。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"耐水性の"},{"sentence":"The **water-resistance** rating of this watch is 3 ATM.","translation":"この時計の耐水性は3気圧です。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"耐水性"},{"sentence":"We need a **water-resistance** sealant for the bathroom tiles.","translation":"浴室のタイルには耐水性のシーラントが必要です。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"耐水性の"}]}

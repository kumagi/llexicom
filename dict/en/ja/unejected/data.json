It is formed by adding the prefix 'un-' to 'ejected,' which is the past participle of 'eject.' The word is most often encountered in technical contexts, such as describing a bullet that has not been ejected from a gun, or in more formal contexts to describe someone who has not been removed from a position. Because it is not a frequently used word, it is important to understand the meaning of 'eject' to fully grasp the meaning of 'unejected.'"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The unejected shell casing jammed the rifle.","translation":"排出されなかった薬莢がライフルを詰まらせた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"排出されていない"},{"sentence":"Despite the controversy, the director remained unejected from the board.","translation":"論争にもかかわらず、取締役はその役員から追放されなかった。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"追放されていない"}]}

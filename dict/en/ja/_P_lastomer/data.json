They are generally more flexible and have better impact resistance than standard plastics, but are not as elastic as elastomers. They are often used in applications where a combination of flexibility and strength is required.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Plastomers are as elastic as rubber.","correct":"✓ Plastomers are less elastic than rubber.","note":"Plastomers have properties between plastics and elastomers, so they are not as elastic as pure elastomers like rubber."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["plastomeric (adjective)"],"phrasal_verbs":[],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Plastomer' is a technical term used in polymer chemistry and materials science.

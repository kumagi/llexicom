'Uniformly-weighted' means that each element is given the same weight or importance. Therefore, 'non-uniformly-weighted' means the opposite: that the elements are not given the same weight.","priority":"N/A"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/ˌnɒn juːnɪˈfɔːrmli ˈweɪtɪd/","syllables":"non-u-ni-form-ly-weight-ed"},"inflection":{"notes":"Adjective; does not inflect."},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"This term is commonly used in statistics, machine learning, and other fields where data analysis involves assigning weights to different elements.

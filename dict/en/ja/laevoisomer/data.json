These molecules have a property called chirality, meaning they exist in two forms that are mirror images of each other. A laevoisomer is the form that rotates polarized light counterclockwise. This is important in fields like pharmaceuticals because the different forms can have different effects on the body.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The pharmaceutical company focused on synthesizing the laevoisomer of the drug.","translation":"その製薬会社は、その薬のレボ異性体の合成に焦点を当てました。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"レボ異性体"},{"sentence":"Only the laevoisomer form of the molecule is biologically active.","translation":"その分子の左旋性異性体のみが生物学的に活性です。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"左旋性の"}]}

It involves using a spectrocolorimeter, an instrument that measures the reflectance or transmittance of light at different wavelengths across the visible spectrum. This data is then used to calculate colorimetric values that can be compared to standards or other samples.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ spectrocolorimetry is a qualitative method.","correct":"✓ spectrocolorimetry is a quantitative method.","note":"Spectrocolorimetry provides numerical data, making it a quantitative rather than qualitative method."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["spectrocolorimetric (adjective)"],"phrasal_verbs":[],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"Spectrocolorimetry is a scientific term referring to the quantitative measurement of color using a spectrocolorimeter.

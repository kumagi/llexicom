When a comet approaches the sun, the heat causes it to release gases and dust, forming a visible tail that points away from the sun due to solar wind and radiation. Comets are often associated with the Oort Cloud and the Kuiper Belt, which are believed to be reservoirs of these icy bodies.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ I saw a comet last night, it was very brightly.","correct":"✓ I saw a comet last night; it was very bright.","note":"\"Brightly\" is an adverb, but we need an adjective to describe the comet.

It refers to a relationship between topological spaces where they are considered equivalent up to continuous deformation. Understanding requires a solid foundation in topology and abstract algebra. The term itself is rarely encountered outside of specialized mathematical literature and research. It's crucial to distinguish it from the more common term 'homotopy,' though they are closely related."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The concept of homoeotopy is fundamental in algebraic topology for classifying topological spaces.","translation":"ホモトピー同値の概念は、位相空間を分類するための代数的位相幾何学において基本的である。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"mathematics"},{"sentence":"Demonstrating homoeotopy between two complex manifolds can reveal deep structural similarities.","translation":"2つの複素多様体間のホモトピー同値を示すことは、深い構造的類似性を明らかにすることができる。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"mathematics"}]}

The suffix '-ment' is added to form a noun indicating the action, process, or result of containing. Therefore, 'containment' refers to the act or state of being contained or the means of containing something.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/kənˈteɪnmənts/","syllables":"con-tain-ments"},"inflection":{"noun_plural":"containments"},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Containments' is the plural form of 'containment,' referring to multiple instances or types of containment. It is often used in contexts where multiple barriers, structures, or strategies are employed to control or limit something, such as hazardous materials, radiation, or the spread of a disease. The term can refer to both physical structures (e.g., containment vessels in a nuclear power plant) and abstract strategies (e.g., containment policies in international relations).","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The containment was not enough to stop the leak, we need more containments.","correct":"✓ The containment was not enough to stop the leak, we need more containment. / ✓ The containment measures were not enough to stop the leak, we need more containment measures.","note":"When referring to the general concept of needing more containment, use the singular 'containment.' Use 'containments' when referring to multiple specific structures or instances of containment. Alternatively, use 'containment measures' (singular) or 'containment measures' (plural)."},{"incorrect":"✗ The containments is very important for safety.","correct":"✓ The containments are very important for safety.","note":"Since 'containments' is plural, the verb must agree and be plural as well ('are')."},{"incorrect":"✗ The containment's was effective.","correct":"✓ The containment was effective. / ✓ The containments were effective.","note":"'Containment's' implies possession, which is usually not the intended meaning.

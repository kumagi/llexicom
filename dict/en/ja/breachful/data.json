It is more frequently encountered in legal or formal contexts. Understanding the word requires familiarity with the more common noun 'breach,' which refers to the act of breaking or failing to observe a law, agreement, or code of conduct. The suffix '-ful' indicates that something is characterized by or full of breaches. Due to its specialized usage, 'breachful' is not typically part of everyday vocabulary."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The company's breachful actions led to significant financial penalties.","translation":"その会社の違反行為は多額の財政的ペナルティにつながった。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"違反の"},{"sentence":"The audit revealed several breachful practices within the organization.","translation":"監査により、組織内でいくつかの違反行為が明らかになった。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"不履行の"},{"sentence":"His breachful conduct resulted in his dismissal from the firm.","translation":"彼の違反行為により、彼は会社から解雇された。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"侵害の"}]}

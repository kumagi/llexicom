It's important to distinguish between the verb and the noun form, and to understand that the noun implies a habitual behavior of criticizing or rebuking others."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The teacher scolded the students for not doing their homework.","translation":"先生は宿題をしてこなかった生徒たちを叱った。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"叱る"},{"sentence":"My grandmother was a notorious scolder, but we all loved her anyway.","translation":"私の祖母は悪名高い小言屋だったが、それでも私たちは皆彼女を愛していた。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"小言を言う人"}]}

This often involves making claims that are too vague, subjective, or circular to be tested empirically. The concept is important in the philosophy of science, where falsifiability is considered a criterion for a theory to be considered scientific. A statement that is unfalsifiable cannot be subjected to scientific scrutiny because there is no conceivable way to disprove it.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The data unfalsifiably supports the hypothesis.","correct":"✓ The hypothesis is unfalsifiable. / ✓ The data does not falsify the hypothesis.","note":"'Unfalsifiably' describes the manner of presentation or argument, not the data itself.

This word is mostly used when talking about ideas or theories, especially in science or philosophy. If someone presents an idea 'unfalsifiably', it means they've made it impossible to test whether the idea is true or false, often because the idea is too vague or based on beliefs rather than evidence. This is important because, in science, a good idea should be 'falsifiable', meaning it should be possible to prove it wrong if it actually is wrong.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The psychic claimed unfalsifiably that she could predict the future, but offered no testable predictions.","translation":"その霊媒師は、未来を予言できると反証不可能な形で主張したが、検証可能な予言は何も提示しなかった。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"manner of claiming"},{"sentence":"The politician's vague promises were delivered unfalsifiably, making it impossible to hold them accountable.","translation":"その政治家の曖昧な約束は反証不可能な形でなされたため、彼らの責任を問うことが不可能になった。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"manner of delivering"},{"sentence":"The conspiracy theory was constructed unfalsifiably, ensuring that any evidence against it could be reinterpreted as further proof.","translation":"その陰謀論は反証不可能なように構築されており、それに反する証拠はすべて、さらなる証拠として再解釈されることが保証されていた。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"manner of construction"}]}

It is often used in academic, legal, or philosophical contexts where arguments and evidence are carefully examined. The term implies a thorough and convincing demonstration of the flaws or errors in a particular claim or theory. It is a stronger term than simply disagreeing or questioning something; it suggests a definitive and well-supported rebuttal.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The confutation was very confuse.","correct":"✓ The confutation was very confusing.","note":"\"Confuse\" is a verb, while \"confusing\" is an adjective that describes something that causes confusion.

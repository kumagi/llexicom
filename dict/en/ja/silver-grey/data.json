It combines the characteristics of 'silver' (a shiny, light grey) and 'grey' (a neutral color between black and white). It is used to provide a more specific and nuanced description of color than either 'silver' or 'grey' alone. The hyphen helps to show that these two words are working together to describe a single characteristic. It is not a very common word, but is easily understood.

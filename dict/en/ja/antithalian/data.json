It is formed by combining the prefix 'anti-' (meaning 'against' or 'opposed to') with 'Thalian,' which relates to Thalia, the Greek muse of comedy and idyllic poetry. Therefore, 'antithalian' describes something or someone opposed to or against Thalia or the cultural aspects associated with her, such as comedy or certain theatrical traditions. Due to its limited use, it is not part of common vocabulary and would primarily appear in academic or specialized contexts related to classical studies or theater history."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The play was criticized for its antithalian elements, which seemed to mock the traditional comedic forms.","translation":"その劇は、伝統的な喜劇の形式を嘲笑しているように見える反タリア的な要素のために批判された。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"反タリア的な"}]}

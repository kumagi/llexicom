It can also be used figuratively to describe something as being full of something else, usually in a negative or humorous way (e.g., 'The report was pewful of errors'). Because of its limited use and somewhat archaic feel, it is not a word typically encountered in everyday English. It is more likely to be found in literature or in humorous writing."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The small chapel was surprisingly pewful for a weekday service.","translation":"その小さな礼拝堂は、平日にもかかわらず驚くほど座席がいっぱいだった。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"座席がいっぱいの"},{"sentence":"The politician's speech was pewful of empty promises.","translation":"その政治家の演説は空約束だらけだった。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"（比喩的に）満ち溢れている"}]}

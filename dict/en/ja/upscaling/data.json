The first, and perhaps more common, is in the context of images and videos. It means to increase the resolution, making the image or video appear sharper and more detailed. This is often done with software or hardware that uses algorithms to guess what the missing pixels should look like. The second meaning is in business, where 'upscaling' refers to making a product or service more luxurious or expensive, targeting a higher-end market. Both meanings involve increasing something to a higher level.

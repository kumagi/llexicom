It is formed by combining 'childish,' which means resembling or typical of a child, and 'looking,' which refers to appearance. The term is generally straightforward to understand, but its usage is less common than simpler alternatives like 'young-looking' or 'baby-faced.' Context is important, as the term can sometimes carry a slightly negative connotation if it implies that someone's appearance is inappropriately young for their age or situation."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"Her childish-looking features often surprise people when they learn her real age.","translation":"彼女の子供っぽい顔立ちは、彼女の本当の年齢を知った人々をしばしば驚かせる。","type":"descriptive","meaning_category":"appearance"},{"sentence":"The actor's youthful charm and childish-looking face made him perfect for the role.","translation":"その俳優の若々しい魅力と子供っぽい顔は、彼をその役にぴったりにした。","type":"descriptive","meaning_category":"appearance"},{"sentence":"Despite being a CEO, she has a disarming, childish-looking smile.","translation":"CEOであるにもかかわらず、彼女には人を安心させる子供っぽい笑顔がある。","type":"descriptive","meaning_category":"appearance"}]}

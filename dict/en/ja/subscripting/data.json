It describes the process of accessing individual items within a data structure (like an array or list) by using an index number. For example, in the code `my_array[5]`, the `[5]` is the subscripting part, indicating that you want to retrieve the item at the 6th position (since indexing often starts at 0). This term is usually encountered in more advanced programming contexts.

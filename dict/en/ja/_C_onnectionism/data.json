It describes a way of understanding how the brain works by focusing on the connections between simple processing units, like neurons. Instead of thinking about rules and symbols, connectionism looks at how learning happens by changing the strength of these connections. Deep learning, which is used in many modern AI applications, is a type of connectionism. This approach is different from older methods that relied on explicit rules.

It signifies a new or altered understanding of something that has already been interpreted. To understand it, one needs to grasp the concept of 'interpretation' itself, which involves explaining or understanding the meaning of something. 'Reinterpretation' then suggests a second look, often with new information or a different perspective, leading to a revised understanding. It's common in fields like history, literature, and art criticism where perspectives evolve over time."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The new biography offers a fascinating reinterpretation of the author's life.","translation":"その新しい伝記は、著者の人生の魅力的な再解釈を提供している。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"新たな解釈"},{"sentence":"The archaeological findings led to a reinterpretation of the site's historical significance.","translation":"その考古学的発見は、遺跡の歴史的意義の再解釈につながった。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"解釈の変更"},{"sentence":"Her reinterpretation of the role brought a fresh perspective to the classic play.","translation":"彼女の役の再解釈は、古典的な劇に新鮮な視点をもたらした。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"新たな解釈"},{"sentence":"The legal team presented a reinterpretation of the contract's clauses.","translation":"弁護団は、契約条項の再解釈を提示した。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"新たな解釈"}]}

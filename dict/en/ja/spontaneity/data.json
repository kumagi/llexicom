It's often used to describe someone who is impulsive and acts on their feelings. For example, you might say someone has a lot of spontaneity if they often do things without thinking about them first. It's a concept often discussed in psychology, art, and philosophy, so you'll encounter it more in academic or intellectual contexts than in everyday conversation.

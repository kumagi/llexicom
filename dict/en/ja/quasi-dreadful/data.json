It combines the prefix \"quasi-\" which means \"resembling\" or \"somewhat,\" with the adjective \"dreadful,\" which means \"terrible\" or \"awful.\" Thus, \"quasi-dreadful\" describes something that is almost or somewhat dreadful, but not completely so. It's used to express a nuanced level of negativity, indicating that something is significantly unpleasant or disappointing without being entirely catastrophic."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The play was quasi-dreadful, saved only by the lead actor's charisma.","translation":"その劇はほとんど恐ろしい出来だったが、主演俳優のカリスマ性だけが救いだった。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"almost dreadful"},{"sentence":"The food at the restaurant was quasi-dreadful; I wouldn't recommend it.","translation":"そのレストランの料理はほとんど恐ろしかった。おすすめはしない。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"somewhat dreadful"}]}

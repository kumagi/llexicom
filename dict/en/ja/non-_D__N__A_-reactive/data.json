It describes a substance that does not form chemical bonds with DNA. This is important because substances that *do* react with DNA can cause mutations and potentially cancer. If a substance is described as 'non-DNA-reactive', it means tests have shown it does not directly damage DNA. This term is primarily encountered in scientific literature and regulatory documents."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The new drug candidate was shown to be non-DNA-reactive, reducing concerns about its potential carcinogenicity.","translation":"その新しい薬候補は非DNA反応性であることが示され、潜在的な発がん性に関する懸念が軽減された。","type":"general"},{"sentence":"Regulatory agencies require testing to determine whether a chemical is DNA-reactive or non-DNA-reactive before it can be approved for use in consumer products.","translation":"規制当局は、化学物質が消費者製品での使用が承認される前に、DNA反応性であるか非DNA反応性であるかを判断するための試験を要求している。","type":"regulatory"}]}

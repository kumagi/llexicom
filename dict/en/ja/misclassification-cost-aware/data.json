It describes models or algorithms designed to minimize the overall cost of misclassifications, where different types of errors (e.g., false positives and false negatives) have different associated costs. This is particularly important in applications where the consequences of certain errors are more severe than others, such as medical diagnosis or fraud detection.","priority":"Medium"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"misclassification cost aware","correct":"misclassification-cost-aware","note":"The hyphenation is important to indicate that this is a compound adjective."}],"priority":"Low"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["misclassification","cost-sensitive learning","cost function"],"phrasal_verbs":[],"priority":"Medium"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low","priority":"Low"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"Advanced","text":"This term is highly technical and specific to the field of machine learning.

It's the opposite of 'foodie', which is someone who loves trying new foods and talking about them. If someone says they're a 'non-foodie', it means they probably don't care much about fancy restaurants or gourmet meals. They might be happy eating simple, everyday food. The word is made by adding 'non-' to 'foodie', which means 'not foodie'."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"My husband is a complete non-foodie; he's happy with a simple burger and fries.","translation":"私の夫は全くの食通ではない。シンプルなハンバーガーとフライドポテトで満足する。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"not interested in food"},{"sentence":"The restaurant catered to non-foodies by offering a simplified menu with familiar dishes.","translation":"そのレストランは、おなじみの料理を盛り込んだシンプルなメニューを提供することで、食通ではない人たちに対応した。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"catering to those not interested in food"}]}

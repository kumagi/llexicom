It describes the quality of something being tragic, similar to how \"happiness\" describes the quality of being happy. It's often used in formal writing or discussions about literature, philosophy, or serious events. Because it's not a frequently used word, it's more likely to be encountered by advanced English learners. It's important to understand the difference between \"tragicalness\" (the quality) and \"tragedy\" (a specific event)."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The **tragicalness** of war is often overlooked in history books.","translation":"歴史書では戦争の悲惨さが見過ごされがちだ。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"悲惨さ"},{"sentence":"The film captured the **tragicalness** of their doomed love affair.","translation":"その映画は彼らの破滅的な恋愛の悲劇性を捉えていた。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"悲劇性"},{"sentence":"He spoke of the **tragicalness** of losing his entire family in the accident.","translation":"彼は事故で家族全員を失ったことの悲惨さを語った。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"悲惨さ"}]}

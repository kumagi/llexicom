It indicates that the vowel should be pronounced separately from the preceding vowel, rather than forming a diphthong. While often used interchangeably with 'umlaut', an umlaut technically indicates a vowel mutation, whereas a trema simply denotes separate pronunciation. In English, its use is relatively rare and often optional, appearing mainly in loanwords like 'naïve', 'coöperate', and occasionally in proper nouns. Style guides often recommend omitting the trema in common words where the pronunciation is clear without it.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The word 'resume' needs a trema.","correct":"✓ The word 'resume' can use an acute accent (résumé) to distinguish it from 'resume' (to start again).","note":"'Resume' (to start again) and 'résumé' (CV) are distinguished by an acute accent, not a trema."},{"incorrect":"✗ Umlauts and tremas are completely different and never used the same way.","correct":"✓ While technically different (umlaut indicates vowel mutation, trema indicates separate pronunciation), the terms are often used interchangeably, especially in informal contexts.","note":"While there is a technical difference, the terms are often used interchangeably."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["diaeresis","diacritic","umlaut"],"phrasal_verbs":[],"priority":"★☆☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2 (specialized vocabulary)","frequency_google_ngram":"Very low frequency.","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"The word \"trema\" refers to a specific type of diacritic mark: two dots placed over a vowel. This mark tells you to pronounce that vowel separately from the vowel before it, instead of combining them into one sound (a diphthong). You'll mostly encounter this term when discussing language or typography. It's not a common word in everyday conversation, but it's useful to know if you're learning about linguistics or working with text that requires precise pronunciation.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The French word 'Noël' has a trema on the 'e'.","translation":"フランス語の「Noël」という単語は、「e」の上にトレマが付いています。","type":"example","meaning_category":"Definition"},{"sentence":"Some style guides suggest omitting the trema in words like 'cooperate'.","translation":"一部のスタイルガイドでは、「cooperate」のような単語のトレマを省略することを推奨しています。","type":"example","meaning_category":"Usage Note"},{"sentence":"The trema helps to avoid mispronunciation of words with adjacent vowels.","translation":"トレマは、隣接する母音を持つ単語の誤った発音を避けるのに役立ちます。","type":"example","meaning_category":"Definition"}]}

It is typically a small glass bottle with a tight-fitting stopper that has a capillary tube running through it. The liquid is filled into the pycnometer, and excess liquid escapes through the capillary, ensuring a precise volume. The mass of the liquid is then measured, and the density is calculated using the formula: density = mass/volume.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ I used a hydrometer instead of pycnometer.","correct":"✓ I used a pycnometer instead of a hydrometer.","note":"Make sure to use the correct instrument name when discussing density measurements."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["pycnometric (adjective)"],"phrasal_verbs":[]},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"The term 'pycnometer' is a specialized term used in chemistry and physics, specifically in the context of measuring the density of liquids.

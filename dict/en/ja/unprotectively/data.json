It is used to describe actions or behaviors that lack caution or safeguards, leaving someone or something vulnerable. Because of its rarity and somewhat complex construction (prefix 'un-' + base word 'protective' + suffix '-ly'), it is considered to be at a C1 level of English proficiency. It is important to understand the meaning of the root word 'protective' and the function of the prefix 'un-' to fully grasp the meaning of 'unprotectively'."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The data was stored unprotectively on a public server.","translation":"データは公共のサーバーに無防備に保存されていた。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"lack of protection"},{"sentence":"The hikers proceeded unprotectively into the dense forest, without proper gear or a map.","translation":"ハイカーたちは適切な装備や地図を持たずに、用心せずに深い森の中へ進んでいった。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"lack of caution"},{"sentence":"She invested her savings unprotectively in a high-risk venture.","translation":"彼女は貯蓄を無防備にハイリスクな事業に投資した。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"lack of precaution"}]}

A heating degree-day occurs when the average daily temperature is below a base temperature (usually 65°F or 18°C), indicating the need for heating. A cooling degree-day occurs when the average daily temperature is above the base temperature, indicating the need for cooling. The number of degree-days in a period (e.g., a month or year) can be used to compare the severity of heating or cooling seasons and to estimate energy consumption. In agriculture, degree-days are used to predict plant and insect development.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The degree-day were high this summer.","correct":"✓ The degree-days were high this summer.","note":"'Degree-day' is countable, so use the plural form 'degree-days' when referring to multiple days or a cumulative value."},{"incorrect":"✗ Degree-day is used only for heating.","correct":"✓ Degree-days are used for both heating and cooling.","note":"Degree-days can refer to both heating degree-days and cooling degree-days."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":[],"phrasal_verbs":[],"related_terms":["base temperature","heating degree day","cooling degree day","growing degree day"],"priority":"★★★"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"B2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency","priority":"★★☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Degree-day' is a technical term used in meteorology, energy management, and agriculture. It represents the cumulative difference between the average daily temperature and a base temperature.

It describes conditions or charts related to isallobars, which are lines on a weather map connecting points that have the same pressure change during a specified time period.

It's not a word you'll hear in everyday conversation. If you're studying weather patterns or reading advanced meteorological reports, you might come across it. The related term 'isallobar' refers to a line on a weather map that connects points with equal pressure changes over a certain time.

Traditionally, it referred to humans and their extinct bipedal relatives. However, modern cladistic taxonomy includes great apes (gorillas, chimpanzees, and orangutans) within the Hominidae family. Therefore, 'hominin' is now often used to refer specifically to humans and their extinct bipedal ancestors after the split from the chimpanzee lineage. 'Hominid-related' can be used more broadly to refer to anything connected to the entire Hominidae family, including great apes.","priority":"★★☆"}],"etymology":{"value":"Derived from 'hominid' (from Latin 'homo' meaning 'man') + 'related'.

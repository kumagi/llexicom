This makes bones more susceptible to fractures, especially in the hip, spine, and wrist. Risk factors include age, gender (more common in women), family history, low calcium intake, vitamin D deficiency, lack of exercise, smoking, and excessive alcohol consumption. Diagnosis is typically made through a bone density scan (DEXA scan). Treatment options include lifestyle changes (diet and exercise) and medications to increase bone density and reduce fracture risk.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ He has osteoporosis in his knee.","correct":"✓ He has osteoporosis. / ✓ He has osteoporosis of the hip.","note":"Osteoporosis is a systemic condition, not localized to a single joint.

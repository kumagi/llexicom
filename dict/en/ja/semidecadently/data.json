It combines 'semi-' (meaning 'half' or 'partly') with 'decadently' (meaning 'characterized by decay, self-indulgence, or moral decline'). Understanding this word requires a good grasp of both its component parts and the broader concept of decadence. It is more likely to appear in literary or academic contexts where nuanced descriptions of moral or cultural states are required."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The hotel, once a symbol of opulence, was now furnished semidecadently, its glory subtly fading.","translation":"かつては富の象徴だったそのホテルは、今では半ば退廃的に家具が置かれ、その栄光はかすかに薄れていた。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"describing a state of partial decline"},{"sentence":"She dressed semidecadently for the party, with a vintage gown and slightly disheveled hair.","translation":"彼女はパーティーのために、ヴィンテージのガウンと少し乱れた髪で、半ば退廃的な服装をした。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"describing appearance"}]}

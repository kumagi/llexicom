Unlike moldboard plows, subplows do not invert the soil. This helps improve water infiltration, root penetration, and overall soil health. They are particularly useful in areas with heavy clay soils or where soil compaction is a problem due to heavy machinery or intensive farming practices.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The subplow inverted the soil completely.","correct":"✓ The subplow loosened the soil without inverting it.","note":"Subplows are designed not to invert the soil, unlike moldboard plows."},{"incorrect":"✗ Use a subplow for surface tillage.","correct":"✓ Use a subplow for deep tillage.","note":"Subplows are used for deep tillage, not surface tillage."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["subsoiling (noun: the act of using a subsoiler)"],"phrasal_verbs":[],"related_terms":["moldboard plow","chisel plow","ripper","tillage","soil compaction","hardpan"],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"N/A","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency - Technical term related to agriculture.","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"The term 'subplow' refers to a specialized agricultural tool used for deep tillage. It's designed to break up compacted soil layers beneath the surface without turning the soil over, which distinguishes it from other types of plows like moldboard plows. This tool is particularly useful for improving drainage and promoting deeper root growth in areas where soil compaction is a problem. Understanding the function and application of a subplow requires knowledge of agricultural practices and soil management.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The subplow was pulled by a large tractor to break up the compacted soil.","translation":"サブプラウは、圧密された土壌を砕くために大型トラクターで牽引された。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"Agricultural tool"},{"sentence":"Using a subplow can significantly improve water infiltration in clay soils.","translation":"サブプラウを使用すると、粘土質土壌への水の浸透を大幅に改善できる。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"Agricultural tool"}]}

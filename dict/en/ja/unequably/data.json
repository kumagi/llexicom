It is used to describe situations where something is not distributed or done in a uniform or fair way. Because it is not a common word, it is more likely to be encountered in formal writing or specialized contexts. It is important to use it correctly as an adverb, modifying verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs to describe how something is done or exists in an unequal way."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The benefits of the new policy were felt unequably across the different regions.","translation":"新政策の恩恵は、異なる地域間で不均等に感じられた。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"不均等に"},{"sentence":"The teacher distributed the candy unequably, favoring some students over others.","translation":"先生はキャンディーを不公平に配り、一部の生徒を他の生徒よりも優遇した。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"不公平に"},{"sentence":"The light fell unequably on the painting, creating areas of deep shadow and bright illumination.","translation":"光は絵に一様に当たらず、深い影と明るい照明の領域を作り出した。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"一様でなく"}]}

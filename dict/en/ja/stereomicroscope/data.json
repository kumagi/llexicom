It uses two separate optical paths with two objectives and eyepieces to provide a slightly different viewing angle to each eye, producing a three-dimensional image.","examples":[{"sentence":"The biologist used a stereomicroscope to examine the insect's anatomy.","translation":"生物学者は昆虫の解剖学的構造を調べるために実体顕微鏡を使用した。"},{"sentence":"Stereomicroscopes are commonly used in manufacturing for quality control.","translation":"実体顕微鏡は、製造業で品質管理によく使用される。"},{"sentence":"The gemologist used a stereomicroscope to inspect the clarity of the diamond.","translation":"宝石学者はダイヤモンドの透明度を検査するために実体顕微鏡を使用した。"}],"collocations":["use a stereomicroscope","examine under a stereomicroscope","observe with a stereomicroscope"],"synonyms":["dissecting microscope","low power microscope","binocular microscope"],"antonyms":[]}],"etymology":{"value":"The term 'stereomicroscope' is derived from 'stereo-' (referring to three-dimensionality) + 'microscope' (an instrument for viewing small objects).","priority":"★★★"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/ˌstɛri.oʊˈmaɪ.krə.skoʊp/","syllables":"ste-re-o-mi-cro-scope"},"inflection":{"noun_plural":"stereomicroscopes"},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"A stereomicroscope provides a three-dimensional view of a sample at relatively low magnification (typically between 10x and 200x).

Unlike compound microscopes, stereomicroscopes do not invert the image.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ I used a electron microscope to see the bug.","correct":"✓ I used a stereomicroscope to see the bug.","note":"Electron microscopes are used for much higher magnification and require special sample preparation.

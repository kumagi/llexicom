'Zone' originates from the Greek word 'zone' (ζώνη), meaning 'girdle' or 'belt.'

It is often used in scientific contexts, such as geography, ecology, and geology, to describe patterns of distribution influenced by factors like climate, altitude, or latitude.

It's often used in science, especially when talking about geography, ecology, or geology. For example, you might talk about the 'zonality' of different types of plants at different altitudes on a mountain. It's a more formal and technical word, so you'll usually find it in academic or scientific writing rather than everyday conversation."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The **zonality** of biomes across the globe is largely determined by latitude and climate patterns.","translation":"地球上の生物群系の帯状構造は、主に緯度と気候パターンによって決定される。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"帯状構造・地域性"},{"sentence":"Understanding the **zonality** of mineral deposits is crucial for efficient mining operations.","translation":"鉱床の地域性を理解することは、効率的な採掘作業に不可欠である。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"帯状構造・地域性"},{"sentence":"The **zonality** observed in coral reefs reflects varying levels of light penetration and water depth.","translation":"サンゴ礁に見られる帯状構造は、光の透過度と水深のさまざまなレベルを反映している。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"帯状構造・地域性"}]}

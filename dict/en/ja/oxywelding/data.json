This flame is then used to melt the base metals and filler metal (if used), joining them together. It is a versatile process suitable for various metals and applications, especially for thinner materials.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ oxywelding is more strong than arc welding.","correct":"✓ oxywelding is less strong than arc welding.","note":"Oxywelding typically produces welds with lower strength compared to arc welding processes."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["oxyacetylene (noun: 酸素アセチレン)","welding (noun: 溶接)","weld (verb/noun: 溶接する/溶接)"],"phrasal_verbs":[]},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"B2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"Oxywelding is a technical term referring to a specific welding process using a gas flame produced by mixing oxygen and a fuel gas, typically acetylene. It's commonly used for joining metals, especially thinner materials, and is known for its versatility. However, it generally produces welds with lower strength compared to other welding methods like arc welding. The term is primarily encountered in technical or engineering contexts related to metalworking.","priority":"★☆☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"Oxywelding allows for precise control over the heat input.","translation":"ガス溶接は、熱入力の精密な制御を可能にします。","type":"general","meaning_category":"process control"},{"sentence":"Safety precautions are crucial when performing oxywelding.","translation":"ガス溶接を行う際には、安全対策が非常に重要です。","type":"safety","meaning_category":"safety precautions"},{"sentence":"Oxywelding is often used in automotive repair shops.","translation":"ガス溶接は、自動車修理工場でよく使用されます。","type":"application","meaning_category":"applications"}]}

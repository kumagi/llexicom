For every particle, like an electron or a proton, there exists an antiparticle with the same mass but opposite electric charge and other quantum numbers. When a particle and its antiparticle collide, they destroy each other in a process called annihilation, which releases energy. This concept is fundamental to understanding particle physics and the nature of matter and antimatter in the universe.

This contrasts with 'interrupt-driven' systems, where the system is notified when data is available or an event occurs, rather than having to actively check. Polling can be simpler to implement but can be less efficient, especially when data or events are infrequent.","priority":"☆☆☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The polling-base system.","correct":"✓ The polling-based system.","note":"Ensure correct spelling of 'based' with a 'd' at the end."}],"priority":"☆☆☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["polling","poll"],"related_terms":["interrupt-driven","event-driven"]},"level_frequency":{"frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency, technical term.","priority":"☆☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Polling-based' is a technical term used to describe systems that periodically check for updates or data.

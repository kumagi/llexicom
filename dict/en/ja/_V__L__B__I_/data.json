It's a complex technique used in radio astronomy to create very detailed images of objects in space. Instead of using one giant telescope, VLBI combines data from many smaller telescopes that are spread out over large distances, even across continents. This allows astronomers to see things with much higher resolution than they could with a single telescope. It's mostly used by scientists and researchers in the field of astronomy.

In mathematics, it describes quantities that can be expressed as integer multiples of a common unit. Figuratively, it describes things that are in proportion or appropriate to each other. The mathematical sense is more precise and technical. The figurative sense is more general and often used in discussions of fairness or justice.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The two ideas are not commensurable because they are completely different.","correct":"✓ The two ideas are not comparable because they are completely different.","note":"Use 'comparable' when discussing whether two things can be compared at all.

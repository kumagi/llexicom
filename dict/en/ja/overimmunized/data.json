It generally refers to a state where an individual has received more immunizations than typically recommended, or when their immune system reacts excessively to immunizations. It is important to note that the concept of being genuinely 'overimmunized' is not widely accepted, as the immune system is generally robust and can handle multiple vaccinations. However, the term may be used in discussions about potential adverse effects of excessive vaccination or in research contexts.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ He is overimmunized to the flu.","correct":"✓ He is overimmunized against the flu.","note":"Use 'against' to specify the disease being protected against."},{"incorrect":"✗ Overimmunized is always bad.","correct":"✓ The effects of being overimmunized are still being studied.","note":"Avoid generalizations.

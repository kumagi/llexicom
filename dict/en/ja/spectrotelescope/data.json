It refers to a telescope that is equipped with a spectroscope, an instrument that separates light into its component colors (spectrum). This allows astronomers to analyze the light from celestial objects to determine their composition, temperature, and other properties. Understanding this term requires familiarity with basic concepts in physics and astronomy."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The new spectrotelescope at the observatory is capable of detecting faint spectral lines.","translation":"天文台の新しい分光望遠鏡は、かすかなスペクトル線を検出することができる。","type":"general","meaning_category":"definition"},{"sentence":"By using a spectrotelescope, they were able to measure the redshift of the distant galaxy.","translation":"分光望遠鏡を使うことによって、彼らは遠い銀河の赤方偏移を測定することができた。","type":"research","meaning_category":"application"}]}

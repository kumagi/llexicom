At lower speeds, the turbojet component provides thrust. As speed increases, the ramjet component becomes more efficient, and the turbojet is gradually bypassed or shut down. This type of engine is typically used in applications requiring high speed and long range.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[],"priority":"N/A"},"related_words":{"derivatives":[],"phrasal_verbs":[]},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"The term \"turboramjet\" refers to a complex type of jet engine that combines the functionalities of both turbojets and ramjets.

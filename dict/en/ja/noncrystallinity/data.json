Crystalline materials have atoms arranged in a highly ordered, repeating pattern. In contrast, noncrystalline (or amorphous) materials lack this long-range order. This term is commonly used in scientific fields like materials science and solid-state physics to describe the structural properties of substances like glass, certain polymers, and amorphous metals.

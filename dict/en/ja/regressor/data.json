Galton observed that the heights of children of tall parents tended to \"regress\" towards the average height of the population. In machine learning, a regressor is a model that performs regression analysis to predict continuous values.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/rɪˈɡresər/","syllables":"re-gres-sor"},"inflection":{"noun_plural":"regressors"},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"In machine learning, a \"regressor\" is a specific type of model designed for regression tasks. Regression models predict continuous numerical values, as opposed to classification models, which predict categorical labels. Common examples of regressors include linear regression, polynomial regression, support vector regression (SVR), and random forest regression. The choice of regressor depends on the specific characteristics of the data and the desired accuracy of the predictions.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ A regressor is used to classify images.","correct":"✓ A regressor is used to predict continuous values.","note":"Regressors are used for regression tasks (predicting continuous values), while classifiers are used for classification tasks (predicting categorical labels)."},{"incorrect":"✗ The regressor outputted a category.","correct":"✓ The regressor outputted a numerical value.","note":"Regressors output numerical values, not categories."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["regression (名詞: 回帰)","regress (動詞: 後退する、退化する)"],"related_terms":["feature engineering (特徴量エンジニアリング)","model evaluation (モデル評価)","hyperparameter tuning (ハイパーパラメータ調整)"],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C1","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency - Primarily used in technical contexts related to machine learning and statistics.","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"The term \"regressor\" is a technical term used in the field of machine learning and statistics.

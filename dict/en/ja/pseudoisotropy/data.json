This usually happens when a material is made up of many tiny parts that are not all aligned in the same way. Understanding this concept requires knowledge of isotropy and anisotropy.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The composite material displayed pseudoisotropy due to the random arrangement of carbon fibers.","translation":"その複合材料は、炭素繊維のランダムな配置により擬似等方性を示した。","type":"general","meaning_category":"General usage"},{"sentence":"In the simulation, the aggregate was modeled as having pseudoisotropy to simplify the calculations.","translation":"シミュレーションでは、計算を簡略化するために、その集合体は擬似等方性を持つものとしてモデル化された。","type":"technical","meaning_category":"Technical context"}]}

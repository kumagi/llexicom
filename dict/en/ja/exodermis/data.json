It is located just beneath the epidermis and acts as a protective barrier, regulating water and nutrient uptake.  It often contains Casparian strips, similar to those found in the endodermis, which further control the movement of substances into the vascular cylinder.  The exodermis can be suberized (coated with suberin), making it impermeable to water and solutes.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The exodermis is the outermost layer of the root.","correct":"✓ The epidermis is the outermost layer of the root; the exodermis is beneath it.","note":"The exodermis is located beneath the epidermis."}],"priority":"★☆☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["exodermal (adjective)"],"phrasal_verbs":[]},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2 (specialized vocabulary)","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Exodermis' is a technical term used in botany to describe a specific layer of cells in plant roots.

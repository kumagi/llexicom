It quantifies how easily a material, particularly soil or rock, can be worn away by natural forces like water, wind, or ice. It's an inherent property of the material itself, influenced by factors like texture, structure, composition, and organic matter content. This term is crucial for assessing environmental risks, planning land use, and implementing conservation strategies.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The erodibility is high because of the rain.","correct":"✓ The erodibility is high, making the area vulnerable to rain.","note":"Erodibility is an inherent property.

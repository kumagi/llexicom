This damage leads to impaired liver function and can be life-threatening. Common causes include chronic alcohol abuse, viral hepatitis infections (like Hepatitis B or C), and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Symptoms often don't appear until significant damage has occurred, but may include fatigue, jaundice, edema in the legs and abdomen, easy bruising/bleeding, and mental confusion. Diagnosis typically involves blood tests, imaging scans, and sometimes a liver biopsy. Treatment focuses on slowing progression and managing complications; a liver transplant is often considered for severe cases."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The patient was diagnosed with **cirrhosis** after undergoing several medical tests.","translation":"患者はいくつかの医学検査を受けた後、肝硬変と診断されました。","type":"medical context","meaning_category":"diagnosis"},{"sentence":"Chronic alcohol abuse is a major risk factor for developing **cirrhosis**.","translation":"慢性的なアルコール乱用は肝硬変を発症する主な危険因子です。","type":"medical context","meaning_category":"cause/risk factor"},{"sentence":"The doctor explained that the **cirrhosis** had progressed to a point where a liver transplant was necessary.","translation":"医師は肝硬変が進行して、肝移植が必要な段階になったと説明しました。","type":"medical context","meaning_category":"progression/treatment"}]}

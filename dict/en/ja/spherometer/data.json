It typically consists of a fine screw that moves vertically, supported by three or more legs that rest on the surface being measured. By measuring the distance the screw moves and the distance between the legs, the radius of curvature can be calculated.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ I used a speedometer to measure the lens.","correct":"✓ I used a spherometer to measure the lens.","note":"Speedometer measures speed, while a spherometer measures curvature.

It's not a commonly used word in everyday conversation, but it's important in technical contexts where accurate measurements of curvature are needed. The device works by measuring the sagitta (the height of the arc) and the radius of the circle formed by the feet of the instrument, allowing for the calculation of the radius of curvature.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The optician used a **spherometer** to check the lens's curvature.","translation":"眼鏡技師は球面計を使ってレンズの曲率をチェックしました。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"measurement instrument"},{"sentence":"The student calibrated the **spherometer** before taking measurements.","translation":"学生は測定を行う前に球面計を校正しました。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"measurement instrument"}]}

It's generally considered a powerful, even overwhelming feeling.  It’s often seen as a basic human instinct but can also have negative connotations related to uncontrolled passion or immoral desires.

The word carries a heavier emotional weight than simply 'sexual desire' and is frequently used in contexts involving temptation, obsession, and strong emotion."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"His eyes followed her with undisguised **lust**.","translation":"彼の目は隠しきれない欲情の眼差しで彼女を追った。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"強い性的な欲望"},{"sentence":"The novel explores the destructive power of **lust** and obsession.","translation":"その小説は、欲情と執着の破壊的な力を探求している。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"強い性的な欲望 (抽象的な意味)"},{"sentence":"He had a **lust** for power and control.","translation":"彼は権力と支配への強い欲求を持っていた。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"強い渇望・執着 (性的な意味以外)"},{"sentence":"The painting depicted scenes of forbidden **lust**.","translation":"その絵画は禁断の欲情を描いていた。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"強い性的な欲望 (芸術作品における表現)"}]}

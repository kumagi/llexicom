This is in contrast to addition polymerization, where all atoms of the monomers are incorporated into the polymer. The reaction often requires heat and/or a catalyst to proceed. The resulting polymers often have different repeating units than the original monomers due to the loss of the small molecules.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Polycondensation is when monomers add together.","correct":"✓ Polycondensation is when monomers combine with the loss of small molecules.","note":"Polycondensation involves the elimination of small molecules, unlike simple addition.

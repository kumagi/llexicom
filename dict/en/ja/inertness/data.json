Inert means lacking the ability or desire to move or react, so \"inertness\" refers to that condition. It's often used in scientific or technical contexts to describe substances that don't readily react chemically, but it can also be used more broadly to describe people or systems that are inactive or stagnant. Because it's a more specialized word, it's not as commonly encountered as simpler synonyms like \"inactivity\" or \"lethargy.\""},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The noble gases are known for their chemical inertness.","translation":"希ガスは化学的不活性で知られている。","type":"general","meaning_category":"chemical"},{"sentence":"The patient's inertness was a worrying sign after the surgery.","translation":"手術後の患者の無気力は、心配な兆候だった。","type":"medical","meaning_category":"physical/medical"},{"sentence":"The inertness of the bureaucracy stifled innovation.","translation":"官僚機構の不活発さがイノベーションを阻害した。","type":"economic/political","meaning_category":"economic/political"}]}

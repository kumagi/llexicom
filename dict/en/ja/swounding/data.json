Thus credulous fools are caught...'Tis true. O monstrous! monstrous! Nay, this was but his dream. But yet it shows a will most rank, Foul disproportion, thoughts unnatural... IAGO: And did you see the handkerchief? OTHELLO: Was that mine? IAGO: Yours, by this hand. And to see how he prizes the foolish woman your wife! She gave it him, and he hath given it his whore. OTHELLO: [Falling into a trance] O, it comes o'er my memory As doth the raven o'er the infectious house, Boding to all—he had my handkerchief. IAGO: Nay, that's certain. But yet the pity of it, Iago! O Iago, the pity of it, Iago! IAGO: If you are so fond over her iniquity, give her patent to offend, for if it touch not you it comes near nobody. OTHELLO: I will chop her into messes! Cuckold me! IAGO: O, 'tis foul in her. OTHELLO: With mine officer! IAGO: That's fouler. OTHELLO: Get me some poison, Iago, this night. I'll not expostulate with her, lest her body and beauty unprovide my mind again. This night, Iago. IAGO: Do it not with poison. Strangle her in her bed, even the bed she hath contaminated. OTHELLO: Good, good! The justice of it pleases. Very good! IAGO: And for Cassio, let me be his undertaker. You shall hear more by midnight. OTHELLO: Excellent good! [A trumpet within] What trumpet is that same? IAGO: I warrant something from Venice. 'Tis Lodovico Come from the duke. See, your wife's with him. [Enter Lodovico, Desdemona, and Attendants] LODOVICO: God save you, worthy general! OTHELLO: With all my heart, sir. LODOVICO: The duke and senators of Venice greet you. [Gives him a letter] OTHELLO: I kiss the instrument of their pleasures. [Opens the letter and reads] DESDEMONA: And what's the news, good cousin Lodovico? IAGO: I am very glad to see you, signior. Welcome to Cyprus. LODOVICO: I thank you. How does Lieutenant Cassio? IAGO: Lives, sir. DESDEMONA: Cousin, there's fall'n between him and my lord An unkind breach, but you shall make all well. OTHELLO: Are you sure of that? DESDEMONA: My lord? OTHELLO: [Reads] 'This fail you not to do, as you will—' LODOVICO: He did not call; he's busy in the paper. Is there division 'twixt my lord and Cassio? DESDEMONA: A most unhappy one. I would do much T'atone them, for the love I bear to Cassio. OTHELLO: Fire and brimstone! DESDEMONA: My lord? OTHELLO: Are you wise? DESDEMONA: What, is he angry? LODOVICO: Maybe the letter moved him, For, as I think, they do command him home, Deputing Cassio in his government. DESDEMONA: By my troth, I am glad on't. OTHELLO: Indeed! DESDEMONA: My lord? OTHELLO: I am glad to see you mad. DESDEMONA: Why, sweet Othello— OTHELLO: Devil! [Strikes her] DESDEMONA: I have not deserved this. LODOVICO: My lord, this would not be believed in Venice, Though I should swear I saw't. 'Tis very much. Make her amends; she weeps. OTHELLO: O devil, devil! If that the earth could teem with woman's tears, Each drop she falls would prove a crocodile. Out of my sight! DESDEMONA: I will not stay to offend you. [Going] LODOVICO: Truly, an obedient lady. I do beseech your lordship, call her back. OTHELLO: Mistress! DESDEMONA: My lord? OTHELLO: What would you with her, sir? LODOVICO: Who, I, my lord? OTHELLO: Ay, you did wish that I would make her turn. Sir, she can turn, and turn, and yet go on, And turn again. And she can weep, sir, weep. And she's obedient, as you say, obedient, Very obedient.—Proceed you in your tears.— Concerning this, sir—O well-painted passion!— I am commanded home.—Get you away. I'll send for you anon.—Sir, I obey the mandate And will return to Venice.—Hence, avaunt! [Exit Desdemona] Cassio shall have my place. And, sir, tonight I do entreat that we may sup together. You are welcome, sir, to Cyprus.—Goats and monkeys! [Exit] LODOVICO: Is this the noble Moor whom our full senate Call all in all sufficient? Is this the nature Whom passion could not shake? whose solid virtue The shot of accident nor dart of chance Could neither graze nor pierce? IAGO: He is much changed. LODOVICO: Are his wits safe? Is he not light of brain? IAGO: He's that he is. I may not breathe my censure What he might be. If what he might he is not, I would to heaven he were! LODOVICO: What, strike his wife! IAGO: Faith, that was not so well; yet would I knew That stroke would prove the worst! LODOVICO: Is it his use? Or did the letters work upon his blood And new-create this fault? IAGO: Alas, alas! It is not honesty in me to speak What I have seen and known. You shall observe him, And his own courses will denote him so That I may save my speech. Do but go after And mark how he continues. LODOVICO: I am sorry that I am deceived in him.

The noun sense, however, is a culturally specific euphemism for a funeral, primarily used within the African-American community. Understanding this usage requires cultural awareness and sensitivity. The term reflects a belief in the deceased's spiritual return to God or a heavenly home. Because of its specific cultural context and euphemistic nature, the noun usage is considered more advanced.","priority":"★☆☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The **home-going** commuters filled the train.","translation":"帰宅する通勤者たちが列車を埋め尽くした。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"帰宅の"},{"sentence":"The **home-going** service was filled with gospel music and heartfelt tributes.","translation":"葬儀はゴスペル音楽と心からの賛辞で満たされた。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"葬式 (婉曲表現)"}]}

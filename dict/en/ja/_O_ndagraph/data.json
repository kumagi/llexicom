It describes a device specifically designed to record wave-like phenomena.

It is more likely to be encountered in older scientific literature.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ I saw an ondagraph on the beach taking pictures.","correct":"✓ I saw an ondagraph's recordings of the waves on the beach.","note":"Ondagraphs record data; they don't take pictures."}],"priority":"★☆☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["onda- (prefix related to waves)","-graph (suffix related to recording instruments)","ondameter (related instrument for measuring wave frequency)"],"phrasal_verbs":[],"priority":"★☆☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"N/A (very rare)","frequency_google_ngram":"Extremely low frequency - a specialized term.","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C2","text":"The word 'ondagraph' is a technical term rarely encountered outside of specialized scientific or historical contexts.

They are formed when an electron absorbs energy and jumps to a higher energy level, leaving behind a 'hole' (the absence of an electron). The electron and hole are attracted to each other by electrostatic forces and can form a bound state, which is the exciton. Excitons can move through the material and transport energy, but they are unstable and eventually recombine, releasing energy in the form of light or heat.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Exciton are important for solar cells.","correct":"✓ Excitons are important for solar cells.","note":"'Excitons' is the plural form, so it requires a plural verb ('are')."},{"incorrect":"✗ The exciton diffuse through the material.","correct":"✓ The excitons diffuse through the material.","note":"When referring to multiple excitons, use the plural form 'excitons' with the plural verb 'diffuse'."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["excitonic (adjective)"],"phrasal_verbs":[],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency.

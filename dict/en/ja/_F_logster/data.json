This practice, known as \"flogging,\" involves posting biased or misleading content, often in the form of fake reviews or endorsements, to promote a product, service, or agenda while concealing the fact that the content is paid for or otherwise incentivized. The term carries a negative connotation, as it implies a lack of transparency and ethical conduct. Understanding the term requires familiarity with internet culture, marketing ethics, and the concept of astroturfing."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The investigation revealed that many so-called 'independent' reviews were actually written by Flogsters hired by the company.","translation":"調査の結果、いわゆる「独立した」レビューの多くは、実際には企業に雇われたFlogsterによって書かれたものであることが明らかになった。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"fake blogger"},{"sentence":"Consumers are becoming more savvy at identifying Flogsters and are less likely to trust online reviews.","translation":"消費者はFlogsterを見抜くのが上手くなり、オンラインレビューを信用しなくなってきている。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"fake blogger"}]}

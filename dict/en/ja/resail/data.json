It is primarily used in contexts related to seafaring and navigation. The word is formed by adding the prefix \"re-\" to the word \"sail,\" indicating a repetition or resumption of the action. It is most often used to describe a ship or vessel that has stopped sailing for some reason (e.g., due to weather conditions or repairs) and is now setting out to sea once more. While the word is straightforward in its meaning, its limited usage makes it less familiar to the average English speaker."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The fleet had to wait out the hurricane before they could resail to their destination.","translation":"艦隊は目的地へ再び出航する前に、ハリケーンが過ぎ去るのを待たなければならなかった。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"再び出航する"},{"sentence":"After the necessary repairs were completed, the yacht was ready to resail.","translation":"必要な修理が完了した後、そのヨットは再び出航する準備ができていた。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"再び出航する"}]}

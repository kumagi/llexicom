It is similar to a switch statement, but it operates on data types rather than values.  It's often used in languages with variant types or dynamic typing to ensure type safety and handle different data structures appropriately.

Imagine you have a box that could contain either a number or a word. A `typecase` allows your program to check what's actually in the box (the type) and then do different things depending on whether it's a number or a word. It's like a special kind of `if` statement that looks at the type of data instead of its value. This is useful for making sure your program doesn't crash when it encounters unexpected types of data."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The compiler uses a `typecase` to determine which version of the function to call.","translation":"コンパイラは`typecase`を使用して、どのバージョンの関数を呼び出すかを決定します。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"型に基づく分岐"},{"sentence":"We can use a `typecase` to handle different kinds of errors.","translation":"`typecase`を使用して、さまざまな種類のエラーを処理できます。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"型に基づく分岐"},{"sentence":"The `typecase` ensures that the correct operation is performed based on the object's actual type.","translation":"`typecase`は、オブジェクトの実際の型に基づいて正しい操作が実行されるようにします。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"型に基づく分岐"}]}

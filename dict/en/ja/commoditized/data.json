This often happens when many companies offer the same thing, and the only way they can compete is by lowering prices. To avoid this, companies try to make their products unique through branding, innovation, or better customer service. Think of something like basic internet service – it's pretty much the same no matter who you get it from, so it's considered commoditized.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The market for smartphones has become increasingly **commoditized**.","translation":"スマートフォン市場はますますコモディティ化している。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"汎用品化した"},{"sentence":"To avoid being **commoditized**, the company focused on providing exceptional customer service.","translation":"コモディティ化を避けるために、その会社は卓越した顧客サービスの提供に焦点を当てた。","type":"verb (past participle used as adjective)","meaning_category":"差別化が困難になった"},{"sentence":"The rise of online education has **commoditized** many traditional courses.","translation":"オンライン教育の台頭により、多くの従来のコースがコモディティ化した。","type":"verb (past participle)","meaning_category":"コモディティ化した"}]}

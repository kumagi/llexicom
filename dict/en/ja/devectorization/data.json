It refers to the process of converting code that operates on arrays or vectors at once into code that operates on individual elements, typically using loops. This is the opposite of vectorization, which aims to improve performance by processing multiple data elements simultaneously. Devectorization is usually done for debugging, compatibility with non-vectorized hardware, or when the overhead of vectorization outweighs its benefits."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The compiler performed automatic devectorization of the loop to improve code portability.","translation":"コンパイラは、コードの移植性を向上させるために、ループの自動ベクトル化解除を実行しました。","type":"General","meaning_category":"Code Optimization"},{"sentence":"Manual devectorization allowed for more fine-grained control over the execution flow.","translation":"手動ベクトル化解除により、実行フローをより細かく制御できるようになりました。","type":"Technical","meaning_category":"Code Control"}]}

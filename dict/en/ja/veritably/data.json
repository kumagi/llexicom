It suggests that something is not just seemingly true, but actually and undeniably so. While 'veritably' and 'truly' are synonyms, 'veritably' often carries a stronger sense of confirmation or affirmation. It is considered a more formal and somewhat archaic word, less commonly used in everyday conversation than 'truly' or 'really'.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The veritably reason is that...","correct":"✓ The veritable reason is that...","note":"'Veritably' is an adverb and modifies verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs.

In this case, 'reason' is a noun, so it should be modified by the adjective 'veritable'."},{"incorrect":"✗ He veritably seemed happy.","correct":"✓ He seemed veritably happy. / ✓ He was veritably happy.","note":"'Veritably' emphasizes the truth of the adjective or verb.

It's used to emphasize that something is really the case. Because it's a more formal word, you're more likely to find it in literature or formal writing than in everyday conversation. For example, 'The experience was veritably life-changing' means the experience truly and genuinely changed the person's life.

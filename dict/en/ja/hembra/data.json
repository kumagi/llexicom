It's like saying 'female' in English when talking about animals. While it can refer to women, it's less common and can sometimes be seen as impolite. So, it's better to use 'mujer' when talking about women. Remember, 'hembra' is feminine, so it goes with words like 'la' (the) and 'una' (a/an)."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"La gata tuvo tres gatitos, dos machos y una hembra.","translation":"The cat had three kittens, two males and one female.","type":"noun","meaning_category":"female animal"},{"sentence":"La hembra del ciervo se llama cierva.","translation":"The female deer is called a doe.","type":"noun","meaning_category":"female animal"},{"sentence":"En esta especie, la hembra es más grande que el macho.","translation":"In this species, the female is larger than the male.","type":"noun","meaning_category":"female animal"}]}

'Self' refers to oneself. 'Subdued' comes from the verb 'subdue', meaning to overcome, quiet, or bring under control. Thus, 'self-subdued' implies that the act of subduing or controlling is performed by oneself on oneself.","priority":"★★★"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/ˌself.səbˈdjuːd/","syllables":"self-sub-dued"},"inflection":{"notes":"As an adjective, it can be modified by adverbs of degree (e.g., very self-subdued, somewhat self-subdued).

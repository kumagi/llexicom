It's a technical term often used in science, engineering, and construction. It's important to distinguish it from 'insulation,' which is the process or state of being insulated, and 'insulator,' which is a device or material used for insulation. The word is derived from the Latin word for 'island,' reflecting the idea of isolation or separation. It's not a commonly used word in everyday conversation, but it's important to know in technical contexts."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The electrician used a special insulant tape to repair the damaged wire.","translation":"電気技師は、損傷したワイヤーを修理するために特殊な絶縁テープを使用しました。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"絶縁体"},{"sentence":"The insulant properties of the foam help keep the building warm in winter.","translation":"そのフォームの断熱特性は、冬に建物を暖かく保つのに役立ちます。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"絶縁性の"}]}

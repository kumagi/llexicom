It's not a word used in everyday conversation very often, but understanding it can help you describe subtle emotional states more accurately."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The child's **sulkiness** persisted throughout the afternoon after being denied a treat.","translation":"おやつを拒否された後、子供のむっつりとした態度は午後を通して続いた。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"不機嫌さ"},{"sentence":"Her **sulkiness** was a clear indication that she was unhappy with the decision.","translation":"彼女の不機嫌さは、彼女がその決定に不満を持っていることの明確な兆候だった。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"不機嫌さ"},{"sentence":"He tried to ignore her **sulkiness**, hoping she would eventually snap out of it.","translation":"彼は彼女のふくれっ面を無視しようとし、最終的には彼女が立ち直ることを願った。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"不機嫌さ"}]}

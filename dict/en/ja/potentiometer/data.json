This adjustment, in turn, controls the flow of current or voltage. Think of it like a dimmer switch for a light; turning the knob changes the resistance, which changes the brightness. Potentiometers have three terminals: two fixed terminals connected to the ends of the resistive element, and a third terminal (the wiper) that slides along the element, allowing you to select a portion of the total resistance. They are used in a wide range of applications, from volume controls in audio equipment to position sensors in robotics. While often used interchangeably with 'variable resistor,' a potentiometer is specifically designed to act as a voltage divider, while a rheostat (another type of variable resistor) is typically used to control current directly."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The engineer used a **potentiometer** to fine-tune the circuit's performance.","translation":"エンジニアは、回路の性能を微調整するためにポテンショメータを使用しました。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"electronic component"},{"sentence":"The **potentiometer** on the amplifier allows you to adjust the volume.","translation":"アンプのポテンショメータを使用すると、音量を調整できます。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"electronic component"},{"sentence":"She acts as a **potentiometer** within the organization, influencing key decisions.","translation":"彼女は組織内でポテンショメータとして機能し、重要な意思決定に影響を与えています。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"figurative influence"}]}

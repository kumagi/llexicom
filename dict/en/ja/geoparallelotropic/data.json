{"word":"geoparallelotropic","priority":"☆☆☆","meanings":[{"part_of_speech":"adjective","definition":"(Rare, technical) Describing a state where the geopotential surfaces and isentropic surfaces are parallel.","english_definition":"(Rare, technical) Relating to a condition in the atmosphere or ocean where surfaces of constant geopotential (gravitational potential energy per unit mass) are parallel to surfaces of constant entropy (isentropic surfaces). This implies a simplified thermodynamic state with specific relationships between pressure, temperature, and density.","examples":[{"sentence":"Under geoparallelotropic conditions, the analysis of atmospheric stability is greatly simplified.","translation":"地衡並行等エントロピー条件下では、大気の安定性の分析が大幅に簡素化される。"},{"sentence":"The geoparallelotropic assumption is often used in theoretical models, though it rarely holds perfectly in the real atmosphere.","translation":"地衡並行等エントロピーの仮定は、実際の気象では完全に成り立つことは稀ですが、理論モデルでよく使用されます。"}],"collocations":["geoparallelotropic atmosphere","geoparallelotropic condition","geoparallelotropic model"],"synonyms":["None - highly specific term"],"antonyms":["Non-geoparallelotropic"],"notes":"This term is highly specialized and primarily used in theoretical meteorology and oceanography. It describes an idealized state rarely observed perfectly in nature. It is related to the geostrophic wind approximation.","related_terms":["geopotential","isentropic","geostrophic","barotropic","baroclinic"]}],"etymology":{"value":"Derived from 'geo-' (earth), 'parallel' (being equidistant and not intersecting), and 'tropic' (relating to turning or changing, here referring to isentropic surfaces). The term combines these elements to describe the parallel relationship between geopotential and isentropic surfaces.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/ˌdʒiːoʊˌpærəˌlɛloʊˈtrɒpɪk/","syllables":"ge-o-par-al-le-lo-trop-ic"},"inflection":{"notes":"This is an adjective and does not inflect in standard English."},"level_frequency":{"frequency_google_ngram":"Extremely rare - used almost exclusively in academic literature.","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C2","text":"The term 'geoparallelotropic' is highly technical and specific to advanced studies in atmospheric science and oceanography.

This term is commonly used in physics, engineering, and materials science to describe deformations or collisions where energy is dissipated, and the original state is not recovered. It is the opposite of 'elastically', which implies a reversible deformation or collision with minimal energy loss.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The rubber band stretched nonelastically and returned to its original shape.","correct":"✓ The rubber band stretched elastically and returned to its original shape.","note":"'Nonelastically' implies that the material does not return to its original shape.

It combines 'nugatory' (meaning trifling or of little value) and 'epilogue' (the concluding section of a literary work). Thus, a 'nugilogue' is a short, unimportant, and often unnecessary concluding remark or statement. It's typically used in informal contexts to playfully downplay the significance of an ending. Understanding the components 'nugatory' and 'epilogue' helps to grasp its meaning."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The play ended with a nugilogue that left the audience chuckling.","translation":"その劇は、観客をクスクス笑わせるような短い結びの言葉で終わった。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"short concluding remark"},{"sentence":"He dismissed his closing statement as a mere nugilogue.","translation":"彼は自分の最後の発言を単なる短い結びの言葉として片付けた。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"insignificant conclusion"}]}

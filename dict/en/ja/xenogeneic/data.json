It is important to distinguish xenogeneic from autologous (from the same individual), allogeneic (from a genetically different individual of the same species), and syngeneic (from a genetically identical individual of the same species). Xenotransplantation, the transplantation of xenogeneic tissues or organs, is a promising but also challenging area of research due to the risk of rejection and disease transmission.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The patient received a allogeneic transplant from a pig.","correct":"✓ The patient received a xenogeneic transplant from a pig.","note":"Allogeneic transplants are from the same species, while xenogeneic transplants are from different species."}],"priority":"★☆☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["xenograft (名詞: 異種移植片)","xenotransplantation (名詞: 異種移植)"],"phrasal_verbs":[],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C2","text":"The term \"xenogeneic\" is a highly specialized term primarily used in the fields of transplantation, immunology, and biomedical research.

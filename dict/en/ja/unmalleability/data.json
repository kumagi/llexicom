Malleability is the property of a material (usually a metal) to be deformed under compressive stress, such as hammering or rolling, without fracturing. Unmalleability is the opposite; a material with high unmalleability will break or shatter rather than deform when subjected to such stress. It is a technical term primarily used in materials science and engineering.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The unmalleability of the situation made it difficult to change.","correct":"✓ The inflexibility of the situation made it difficult to change.","note":"'Unmalleability' typically refers to physical materials, not abstract situations.

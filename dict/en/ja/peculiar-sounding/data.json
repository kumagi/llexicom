One would likely use 'more peculiar-sounding' or 'most peculiar-sounding' rather than inflected forms."},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Peculiar-sounding' is used to describe sounds that are noticeably different from what is expected or typical. It implies that the sound is unusual enough to be noteworthy.

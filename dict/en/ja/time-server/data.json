It is crucial for systems that require precise timekeeping, such as financial transactions, logging, and scientific experiments. Time servers are often categorized by stratum levels, indicating their distance from a reference clock (like an atomic clock).","priority":"★★★"},"level_frequency":{"frequency_google_ngram":"Relatively infrequent, but common in technical contexts.","priority":"★★☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"B2","text":"A 'time server' is a computer that tells other computers on a network what time it is. It's important because many computer systems need to know the exact time to work correctly. These servers use special rules (protocols) like NTP to make sure everyone has the same, accurate time. They're especially important for things like banking or science where timing is critical."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The security system relies on a reliable **time server** to accurately record events.","translation":"セキュリティシステムは、イベントを正確に記録するために、信頼性の高いタイムサーバに依存しています。","type":"general"},{"sentence":"We need to configure the new server as a **time server** for the local network.","translation":"新しいサーバをローカルネットワークのタイムサーバとして設定する必要があります。","type":"configuration"},{"sentence":"The **time server** uses GPS signals to maintain its accuracy.","translation":"タイムサーバは、その精度を維持するためにGPS信号を使用します。","type":"accuracy"}]}],"etymology":{"value":"The term 'time server' is a compound word formed from 'time' and 'server,' reflecting its function of serving time information.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/ˈtaɪm ˌsɜːrvər/","syllables":"time-serv-er"},"inflection":{"notes":"Plural: time servers"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ time service","correct":"✓ time server","note":"The correct term is 'time server,' not 'time service' when referring to the server itself."}]}}

These sacs are located between the anus and the external genitalia. Both male and female beavers possess these sacs. Castoreum has historically been used in perfumes and as a food additive. It imparts a musky, leathery, or vanilla-like scent and flavor. In food, it is often listed as a 'natural flavoring'.

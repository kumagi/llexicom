These concerns are called cross-cutting concerns. Common examples include logging, security, and transaction management. AOP achieves this modularization by introducing aspects, which define the cross-cutting concern, and advice, which specifies when and where the aspect should be applied.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ AOP is a type of database.","correct":"✓ AOP is a programming paradigm.","note":"AOP is related to programming, not data storage."},{"incorrect":"✗ You can use AOP to design user interfaces.","correct":"✓ You can use AOP to handle cross-cutting concerns like logging or security.","note":"AOP is for modularizing cross-cutting concerns, not UI design."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["aspect","advice","join point","pointcut","weaving"],"related_concepts":["cross-cutting concerns","separation of concerns","modularity","bytecode manipulation"],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"level":"Advanced (Computer Science)","frequency_google_ngram":"Low","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"Advanced","text":"AOP stands for Aspect-Oriented Programming. It's a way to write code that separates different parts of your program that might otherwise be mixed together. Think of it like adding special effects to a movie – you can apply the same effect to many different scenes without having to change each scene individually. This makes the code easier to understand and change. It's mostly used by experienced programmers. Key concepts include 'aspects' (the special effects) and 'advice' (when and where to apply them)."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"AOP allows developers to modularize cross-cutting concerns such as logging and security.","translation":"AOPを使用すると、開発者はロギングやセキュリティなどのクロス・カッティングな関心をモジュール化できます。","type":"definition","meaning_category":"Definition"},{"sentence":"The use of AOP can lead to more maintainable and testable code.","translation":"AOPを使用すると、保守性とテスト容易性が向上したコードを作成できます。","type":"benefit","meaning_category":"Benefits"},{"sentence":"Spring AOP is a popular framework for implementing AOP in Java applications.","translation":"Spring AOPは、JavaアプリケーションでAOPを実装するための一般的なフレームワークです。","type":"example","meaning_category":"Framework"}]}

This is in contrast to 'circuit-switched' networks, where a dedicated path is established for the duration of a communication session. Packet switching is more efficient for data transmission because it allows multiple users to share the same network resources.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The packet switch network is very fast.","correct":"✓ The packet-switched network is very fast.","note":"The correct term is 'packet-switched network,' not 'packet switch network.'

It describes a method of transmitting data where the data is divided into small units called packets. Each packet contains addressing information and is routed independently across the network. This is more efficient than circuit switching, where a dedicated connection is established between two points. Understanding this term requires some basic knowledge of networking concepts."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"Modern communication relies heavily on **packet-switched** networks.","translation":"現代の通信は、パケット交換ネットワークに大きく依存しています。","type":"general","meaning_category":"general"},{"sentence":"The transition to a **packet-switched** infrastructure improved network scalability.","translation":"パケット交換インフラへの移行により、ネットワークのスケーラビリティが向上しました。","type":"technical","meaning_category":"technical"}]}

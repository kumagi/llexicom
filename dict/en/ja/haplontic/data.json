It describes organisms where the dominant phase is haploid, meaning they have only one set of chromosomes for most of their life. The diploid phase is very short, limited to the zygote stage. This term is typically encountered in advanced biology courses or scientific literature. Understanding the concept requires familiarity with basic genetics and reproductive biology.","example_sentences":[]}}

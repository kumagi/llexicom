'Devour' comes from the Old French 'devorer', which in turn comes from the Latin 'devorare', meaning 'to swallow down, consume greedily'. The suffix '-able' indicates the capacity or ability to be acted upon, so 'devourable' means 'able to be devoured'.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/dɪˈvaʊərəbəl/","syllables":"de-vour-a-ble"},"inflection":{"notes":"This is an adjective, so it can be modified by adverbs (e.g., 'very devourable') and can be used in comparative and superlative forms (more devourable, most devourable), although these are less common."},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Devourable' is often used to describe food that is particularly tasty and easy to eat quickly. It can also be used metaphorically to describe things that are consumed eagerly and with great enthusiasm, such as books, movies, or other forms of entertainment.

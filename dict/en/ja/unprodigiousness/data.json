It is formed by negating the word 'prodigiousness', which itself is derived from 'prodigious'. To understand 'unprodigiousness', one must first understand 'prodigious', meaning extraordinarily large, impressive, or indicative of a portent. Therefore, 'unprodigiousness' describes the absence of these qualities, indicating something is ordinary, unremarkable, or small in scale. Due to its complexity and rarity, it is typically encountered in advanced academic or literary contexts."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The critic noted the unprodigiousness of the author's early works compared to his later, more ambitious novels.","translation":"評論家は、著者の初期の作品が、後のより野心的な小説に比べて並外れていないことを指摘した。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"非巨大性"},{"sentence":"Despite the hype, the film's unprodigiousness in terms of special effects was disappointing.","translation":"宣伝にもかかわらず、映画の特殊効果が並外れていなかったことは残念だった。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"非並外れた大きさ"},{"sentence":"The unprodigiousness of the increase in sales suggested a need for a new marketing strategy.","translation":"売上高の増加が並外れていなかったことは、新たなマーケティング戦略の必要性を示唆していた。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"並外れていないこと"}]}

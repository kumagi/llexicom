It's more specific than simply saying something is 'noisy' because it implies a jarring and unharmonious quality to the sound. You would use this word when you want to emphasize the unpleasantness of a sound due to its lack of harmony or order. For example, a construction site might be described as 'cacophonous' due to the loud, clashing sounds of machinery and tools."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The band's experimental music was a cacophonous assault on the ears.","translation":"そのバンドの実験的な音楽は、耳に対する耳障りな攻撃だった。","type":"general","meaning_category":"discordant mixture of sounds"},{"sentence":"The marketplace was a cacophonous scene, with vendors shouting and customers haggling.","translation":"市場は、露天商が叫び、客が値切る騒々しい光景だった。","type":"general","meaning_category":"noisy and discordant"}]}

It is most commonly understood to mean removal of the entire uterus and cervix, but *not* the ovaries and fallopian tubes. However, some sources use it to mean removal of the uterus, cervix, ovaries, and fallopian tubes. To avoid confusion, it is best to specify whether the ovaries and fallopian tubes are also being removed. If the ovaries and fallopian tubes are removed, the procedure is more accurately called a 'total hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy'.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{},"related_words":{"derivatives":["hysterectomy","salpingectomy","oophorectomy","total hysterectomy","partial hysterectomy","radical hysterectomy"],"phrasal_verbs":[],"priority":"★★★"},"level_frequency":{},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C2","text":"'Panhysterectomy' is a highly specialized medical term referring to the surgical removal of the entire uterus.

It is not as commonly used as the adjective 'drunk' but is understood in formal and informal contexts. It is more descriptive than simply stating someone is drunk, as it specifies how their inebriation affects their behavior. The word is relatively straightforward to understand, but its usage is less frequent, making it more suitable for intermediate to advanced learners."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The clown waved drunkly at the children.","translation":"そのピエロは酔っぱらって子供たちに手を振った。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"manner"},{"sentence":"He sang drunkly at the karaoke bar.","translation":"彼はカラオケバーで酔っぱらって歌った。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"manner"},{"sentence":"She apologized drunkly for her behavior.","translation":"彼女は自分の行動について酔っぱらって謝罪した。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"manner"}]}

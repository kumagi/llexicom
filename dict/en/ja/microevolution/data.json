It focuses on changes in gene frequency within a population over a relatively short period.

It is distinct from \"macroevolution,\" which refers to larger-scale evolutionary changes, such as the origin of new species or major evolutionary lineages.

Think of it as fine-tuning within a species. For example, if a population of insects becomes resistant to a certain pesticide, that's microevolution. It's different from \"macroevolution,\" which refers to bigger changes, like the development of entirely new species. Understanding microevolution helps scientists study how populations adapt to their environments. It's a more technical term, so you'll usually find it in scientific discussions or textbooks.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The peppered moth's change in color during the Industrial Revolution is a classic example of **microevolution**.","translation":"産業革命中のコショウ蛾の色の変化は、微小進化の古典的な例です。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"evolutionary change within a species"},{"sentence":"Scientists use genetic markers to track **microevolution** in populations of endangered species.","translation":"科学者たちは、遺伝的マーカーを使って、絶滅危惧種の個体群における微小進化を追跡します。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"evolutionary change within a species"},{"sentence":"Understanding **microevolution** is crucial for developing effective strategies to combat antibiotic resistance.","translation":"微小進化を理解することは、抗生物質耐性に対抗するための効果的な戦略を開発するために不可欠です。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"evolutionary change within a species"},{"sentence":"**Microevolution** can be driven by natural selection, genetic drift, and gene flow.","translation":"微小進化は、自然選択、遺伝的浮動、および遺伝子流動によって引き起こされる可能性があります。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"evolutionary change within a species"}]}

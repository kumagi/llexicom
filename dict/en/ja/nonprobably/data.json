It is formed by adding the prefix 'non-' to 'probably', indicating negation. While grammatically correct, it is less commonly used than alternatives such as 'improbably' or 'unlikely'. Its usage is typically found in formal or technical contexts where a precise expression of low probability is desired. Due to its infrequent use, it may not be immediately understood by all English speakers, making it advisable to consider more common alternatives for clarity in general communication."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"Nonprobably, the experiment will yield the desired results given the current setup.","translation":"現在の設定では、実験が期待される結果をもたらす可能性は低い。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"unlikely"},{"sentence":"The company will nonprobably announce profits this quarter due to the economic downturn.","translation":"景気後退のため、同社が今四半期に利益を発表する可能性は低い。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"unlikely"}]}

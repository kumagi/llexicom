'Institution' comes from Latin 'institutio', meaning 'establishment, instruction'. The suffix '-ize' means 'to cause to become'. The suffix '-ed' indicates a past participle or adjective form. Therefore, 'institutionalized' literally means 'having been made part of an institution' or 'having become dependent on an institution'.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/ˌɪnstɪˈtjuːʃənəlaɪzd/","syllables":"in-sti-tu-tion-al-ized"},"inflection":{"notes":"This word is primarily used as an adjective and past participle.

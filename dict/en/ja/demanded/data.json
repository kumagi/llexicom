'Demand' comes from the Old French word 'demander,' which in turn comes from the Latin word 'demandare,' meaning 'to entrust, commit, or charge.'

It suggests that the speaker or actor expects their request to be fulfilled without question. It is stronger than simply 'asked' or 'requested.' The word can also imply that there may be negative consequences if the demand is not met.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ He demanded for an apology.","correct":"✓ He demanded an apology.","note":"The verb 'demand' does not require the preposition 'for' when followed by the thing being demanded.

This means the verb in the clause is in its base form (without 'to' or any tense markers). In more formal English, 'should' can be inserted before the verb: 'She demanded that he should leave.'"}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["demand (noun: 要求、需要; verb: 要求する)","demanding (adjective: 要求の多い、骨の折れる)"],"phrasal_verbs":["No common phrasal verbs with 'demand' are typically used with 'demanded' in the past tense.

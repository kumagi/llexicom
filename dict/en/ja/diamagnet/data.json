All materials exhibit diamagnetism, but it is usually very weak. It is most pronounced in materials where other forms of magnetism are absent.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The diamagnet attract to the magnet.","correct":"✓ The diamagnet repels from the magnet.","note":"Diamagnets are repelled, not attracted, by magnetic fields."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["diamagnetism (noun: 反磁性)","diamagnetically (adverb: 反磁性的に)"],"phrasal_verbs":[]},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Diamagnet' refers to a material that creates a magnetic field in opposition to an external magnetic field, causing it to be repelled. It's a term used in physics and chemistry, particularly when discussing the magnetic properties of substances. The concept can be complex, involving electron behavior and quantum mechanics, making it more suitable for advanced learners or those with a background in science."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"Bismuth is a well-known **diamagnet**.","translation":"ビスマスはよく知られた反磁性体です。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"反磁性体"},{"sentence":"**Diamagnetic** levitation can be achieved using strong magnets and certain materials.","translation":"反磁性浮揚は、強力な磁石と特定の材料を使用して実現できます。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"反磁性の"}]}

It describes the state where a lens system is designed to eliminate both spherical aberration (blurring due to different parts of the lens focusing light at different points) and coma (an off-axis aberration causing points to appear as comet-like shapes). Understanding this term requires a solid foundation in physics and optical engineering. It is not commonly encountered outside of technical contexts."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The telescope's objective lens was designed with aplanatism to minimize image distortion.","translation":"その望遠鏡の対物レンズは、像の歪みを最小限に抑えるために非点収差補正を施して設計された。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"optics"},{"sentence":"Achieving aplanatism in microscope lenses is crucial for high-resolution imaging.","translation":"顕微鏡レンズで非点収差補正を実現することは、高解像度イメージングにとって非常に重要である。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"optics"}]}

'Implicitly' comes from 'implicit', which is derived from the Latin 'implicitus', the past participle of 'implicare' meaning 'to involve, entangle'. Therefore, 'unimplicitly' reverses the sense of 'implied' or 'suggested' to mean 'not implied' or 'explicitly stated'.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/ˌʌnɪmˈplɪsɪtli/","syllables":"un-im-plic-it-ly"},"inflection":{"notes":"Adverbs do not inflect"},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Unimplicitly' is the direct opposite of 'implicitly'. While 'implicitly' means something is suggested or understood without being directly stated, 'unimplicitly' means something is stated directly and clearly, leaving no room for doubt or implication.

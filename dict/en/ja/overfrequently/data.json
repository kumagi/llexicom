It's not a very common word, so you might not hear it often. It's used when something is done too much, to the point where it becomes a problem or annoyance. For example, if someone checks their phone all the time, you could say they check it \"overfrequently.\" It's similar to saying \"too often\" or \"excessively often.\" Because it's not a common word, using simpler phrases might be clearer for most people."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The software sent notifications overfrequently, which users found irritating.","translation":"そのソフトウェアは通知を頻繁に送りすぎて、ユーザーはそれをいらいらさせた。","type":"general"},{"sentence":"He overfrequently interrupted the speaker, making it difficult to follow the presentation.","translation":"彼は頻繁に話し手の話を遮りすぎて、プレゼンテーションを理解することを困難にした。","type":"general"}]}

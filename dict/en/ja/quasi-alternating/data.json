It is combined with 'alternating,' which describes something that occurs in a sequence of two or more things, each used in turn. Therefore, 'quasi-alternating' describes something that appears to alternate but does not do so perfectly or consistently.","priority":"★★★"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/ˌkweɪzaɪˈɔːltərneɪtɪŋ/","syllables":"quasi-al-ter-nat-ing"},"inflection":{"notes":"Adjectives do not typically inflect in English, other than to form comparative and superlative forms. However, 'quasi-alternating' is rarely used in comparative or superlative forms."},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Quasi-alternating' is used to describe processes, patterns, or behaviors that resemble alternation but do not strictly adhere to a perfectly alternating sequence. It implies an approximate or imperfect alternation. It is often used in scientific or technical contexts where precise alternation is not achieved or required.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The signal was completely quasi-alternating.","correct":"✓ The signal was nearly quasi-alternating.","note":"'Quasi-' already implies approximation, so using 'completely' is contradictory.

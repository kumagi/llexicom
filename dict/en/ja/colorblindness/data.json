It's more common in men than women, and it's usually something they're born with. While the name suggests not seeing any colors, most people with colorblindness can still see some colors, just not all of them correctly. It's often called 'color vision deficiency' now, which is a more accurate term because it's not really about being 'blind' to colors completely.

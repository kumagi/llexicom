It's used to describe how something is presented or stated. Because it's not a common word, it's more likely to be found in formal writing or speech where precision is important. It is an adverb, so it modifies a verb. For example, 'The report unfactually described the events' means that the report described the events in a way that was not accurate or based on facts."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The politician unfactually portrayed his opponent's voting record.","translation":"その政治家は、対立候補の投票記録を事実に基づかずに描写した。","type":"example","meaning_category":"general"},{"sentence":"The witness testified unfactually about the timeline of events.","translation":"その証人は、出来事のタイムラインについて事実に基づかずに証言した。","type":"example","meaning_category":"general"},{"sentence":"The advertisement unfactually claimed the product could cure all diseases.","translation":"その広告は、その製品がすべての病気を治せると事実に基づかずに主張した。","type":"example","meaning_category":"general"}]}

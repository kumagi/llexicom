It is formed by combining \"atheistic\" (an adjective describing something related to atheism) with the suffix \"-ness\" (which turns adjectives into nouns representing a quality or state). Therefore, \"atheisticness\" refers to the quality or state of being atheistic, or the degree to which something is atheistic. Its use is generally limited to philosophical or academic discussions about atheism. Due to its complexity and infrequent usage, it is considered a C2 level word.","example_sentences":[]}}

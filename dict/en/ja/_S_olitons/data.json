They maintain their shape and speed even after colliding with other solitons. This stability is due to a balance between nonlinear effects and dispersion. Solitons are found in various physical systems, including fluid dynamics, optics, and plasma physics. They are of particular interest in telecommunications, where they can be used to transmit data over long distances without significant signal degradation.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[],"priority":"☆☆☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["solitary wave","Korteweg–de Vries equation","nonlinear system","dispersion","nonlinearity"],"phrasal_verbs":[],"priority":"☆☆☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low","priority":"☆☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C2","text":"Solitons are advanced physics concept and require a strong understanding of wave mechanics and nonlinear systems.","priority":"☆☆☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The propagation of solitons in optical fibers is crucial for high-speed data transmission.","translation":"光ファイバーにおけるソリトンの伝播は、高速データ伝送にとって重要です。","type":"physics","meaning_category":"Wave mechanics"},{"sentence":"Scientists are studying the behavior of solitons in Bose-Einstein condensates.","translation":"科学者たちは、ボース＝アインシュタイン凝縮におけるソリトンの挙動を研究しています。","type":"physics","meaning_category":"Wave mechanics"}]}

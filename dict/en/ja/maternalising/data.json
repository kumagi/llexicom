It's usually used when someone is treating another person (often an adult) like a child, which can sometimes be seen as overbearing or disrespectful of their independence. The word implies a specific type of behavior that goes beyond simple caring and enters the realm of potentially stifling or infantilizing another person. It's not a common word, so understanding its nuances requires a good grasp of abstract concepts and social dynamics."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The teacher was accused of maternalising the students, preventing them from developing independence.","translation":"その教師は生徒たちをまるで母親のように扱い、自立心を育むことを妨げていると非難された。","type":"verb (present participle)","meaning_category":"treating like a mother"},{"sentence":"He didn't appreciate his boss maternalising him, constantly checking up on his progress.","translation":"彼は上司がまるで母親のように自分に接し、常に進捗状況を確認してくることをありがたく思わなかった。","type":"verb (present participle)","meaning_category":"being overprotective"}]}

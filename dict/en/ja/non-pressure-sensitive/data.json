It's often used in the context of technology, materials science, and manufacturing. For example, a non-pressure-sensitive adhesive requires a different activation method (like heat or moisture) compared to a pressure-sensitive adhesive.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The pen is non pressure sensitive.","correct":"✓ The pen is non-pressure-sensitive.","note":"The hyphen is important for clarity.

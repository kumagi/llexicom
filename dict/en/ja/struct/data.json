It represents a way to group together different variables (which can be of different types) under a single name, allowing them to be treated as a single unit. Understanding 'struct' is essential for anyone working with languages like C, C++, and others that support this concept. It's a building block for creating more complex data types and organizing data efficiently. The concept is similar to 'class' but with key differences, particularly in how they handle memory and access modifiers (especially in C++)."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"We used a `struct` to store the x and y coordinates of a point.","translation":"点のx座標とy座標を格納するために`struct`を使用しました。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"構造体"},{"sentence":"The `struct` keyword is used to define a new data type.","translation":"`struct`キーワードは、新しいデータ型を定義するために使用されます。","type":"keyword","meaning_category":"キーワード"},{"sentence":"Accessing members of a `struct` is done using the dot operator.","translation":"`struct`のメンバへのアクセスは、ドット演算子を使用して行われます。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"構造体"},{"sentence":"The `struct` can contain variables of different data types.","translation":"`struct`には、異なるデータ型の変数を含めることができます。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"構造体"}]}

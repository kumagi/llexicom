Because males and females have different combinations of these chromosomes (males typically have XY, and females have XX), traits determined by these genes can show different patterns of inheritance in each sex. For example, a recessive gene on the X chromosome will be expressed in males because they only have one X chromosome, while females would need two copies of the recessive gene to express the trait. Understanding sex-linkage is important for predicting the inheritance of certain genetic conditions, such as hemophilia and color blindness."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The study of sex-linkage helped to explain the inheritance patterns of hemophilia in the royal families of Europe.","translation":"性連鎖の研究は、ヨーロッパの王室における血友病の遺伝パターンを説明するのに役立った。","type":"general","meaning_category":"general"},{"sentence":"Because males are hemizygous for the X chromosome, they are more likely to express recessive sex-linked traits.","translation":"男性はX染色体に関して片側ヘミ接合性であるため、劣性の性連鎖形質を発現しやすい。","type":"technical","meaning_category":"technical"}]}

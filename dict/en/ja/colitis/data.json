It's important to understand that this condition can stem from various causes, including infections, autoimmune disorders (like ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease), and reduced blood flow (ischemic colitis). Symptoms often involve abdominal pain, diarrhea, and rectal bleeding. Diagnosis usually requires medical procedures such as colonoscopies and biopsies to determine the specific cause and guide appropriate treatment.

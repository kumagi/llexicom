It can also mean having the broader rights and privileges of citizenship. The term is often used in discussions of political history, social justice, and civil rights.

It's often used when talking about historical events or social changes where groups of people gained the right to vote for the first time. For example, you might read about how women were enfranchised in the early 20th century, meaning they were given the right to vote. It's a formal word, so you'll mostly see it in writing or in serious discussions about politics and rights.

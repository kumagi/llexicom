It's a way of controlling pests (like insects or weeds) in a way that's good for the environment. Instead of just using chemicals, IPM uses different methods like introducing natural enemies of the pests, changing farming practices, and only using pesticides when absolutely necessary. The goal is to keep pests under control without harming the environment or people's health. It's a complex approach that requires knowledge of pest biology and ecology.","priority":"★★★"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The orchard implemented an **IPM** program to control codling moths.","translation":"その果樹園は、コドリンガを制御するためにIPMプログラムを実施しました。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"Integrated Pest Management"},{"sentence":"**IPM** focuses on preventing pest problems before they occur.","translation":"IPMは、害虫の問題が発生する前に予防することに焦点を当てています。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"Integrated Pest Management"}]}

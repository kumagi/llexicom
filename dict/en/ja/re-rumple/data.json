It is formed by adding the prefix \"re-\" to the word \"rumple.\" This word is most likely to be encountered in descriptive writing where the author wants to emphasize the repeated disarrangement of something. Due to its infrequent usage, it is not typically part of standard English vocabulary. Understanding the meaning of the base word \"rumple\" and the prefix \"re-\" is helpful in deciphering its meaning.

It's formed from 'guide,' with 'un-' meaning 'not,' and '-able' meaning 'capable of being.' The '-ly' turns it into an adverb. Use it to describe situations where control or direction is impossible, like a ship lost at sea or a project without leadership. It's not a common word, so use it when you specifically want to emphasize the impossibility of guidance."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The missile flew unguidably after the control systems failed.","translation":"制御システムが故障した後、ミサイルは誘導不可能に飛んだ。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"lack of guidance"},{"sentence":"The negotiations proceeded unguidably, leading to a complete breakdown.","translation":"交渉は誘導不可能に進み、完全な決裂につながった。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"lack of direction"}]}

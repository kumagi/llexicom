However, it is most commonly used in audio engineering to describe a type of audio effect. In the context of audio, a saturator adds harmonics and subtle distortion to a sound, making it sound richer, warmer, and louder. Different types of saturators emulate the sound of analog equipment like tubes or tape machines.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The saturator made the image less colorful.","correct":"✓ The saturator made the image more colorful.","note":"A saturator increases color intensity, so it wouldn't make an image less colorful."},{"incorrect":"✗ Use a noise gate instead of a saturator to add warmth.","correct":"✓ Use a saturator instead of a noise gate to add warmth.","note":"A saturator adds warmth and harmonics, while a noise gate reduces noise."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["saturate","saturation","saturated"],"phrasal_verbs":[],"related_terms":["distortion","overdrive","exciter","compressor","limiter","EQ"],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"N/A","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Saturator' has two primary meanings. Generally, it refers to something that causes saturation, meaning it fills something completely. More specifically, in audio engineering, a 'saturator' is a tool or plugin that adds harmonics and subtle distortion to audio signals. This effect makes the sound richer, warmer, and louder. It's a technical term, so it's more common in specialized contexts like music production or chemical engineering. The audio engineering usage is more prevalent in modern discussions.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The chemical plant uses a large saturator to prepare the solution.","translation":"その化学工場では、溶液を準備するために大型のサチュレーターを使用しています。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"飽和剤"},{"sentence":"Adding a saturator to the bass guitar track gave it more punch.","translation":"ベースギターのトラックにサチュレーターを加えることで、よりパンチのあるサウンドになった。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"音響機器"},{"sentence":"Experiment with different settings on the saturator to achieve the desired effect.","translation":"目的の効果を得るために、サチュレーターのさまざまな設定を試してください。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"音響機器"}]}

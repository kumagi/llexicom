This is in contrast to thermoplastics, which can be repeatedly softened by heating and hardened by cooling. Nonthermoplastics are also known as thermosets.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The nonthermoplastic can be melted again.","correct":"✓ The nonthermoplastic cannot be melted again.","note":"Nonthermoplastics cannot be melted again.

It refers to plastics that, once molded and hardened, cannot be melted and reshaped. This is because the heating process causes an irreversible chemical change.

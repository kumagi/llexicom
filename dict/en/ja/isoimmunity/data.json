This concept is particularly relevant in medical contexts such as pregnancy (where Rh incompatibility can occur), blood transfusions (where reactions can arise due to differing blood types), and organ transplantation (where the recipient's immune system may reject the donor organ). Understanding isoimmunity requires knowledge of immunology and genetics, particularly concerning antigens and histocompatibility complexes. The term is primarily used in specialized medical and scientific literature.

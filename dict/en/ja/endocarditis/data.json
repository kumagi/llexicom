It is typically caused by bacterial or fungal infections that enter the bloodstream and settle in the heart. This condition is more common in individuals with pre-existing heart conditions, artificial heart valves, or a history of intravenous drug use. Symptoms can include fever, fatigue, heart murmurs, and shortness of breath. Diagnosis often involves blood cultures and echocardiography. Treatment usually requires prolonged antibiotic therapy, and in some cases, surgery to repair or replace damaged heart valves.

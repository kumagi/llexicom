It reads the entire source code at once, performs analysis, and then translates it into machine code or an intermediate representation. This resulting code can then be executed directly by the computer's processor or by a virtual machine. Compilers often perform optimizations to improve the performance of the generated code.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The compiler interpret the code.","correct":"✓ The compiler compiles the code.","note":"Compilers *compile* code, while interpreters *interpret* code.

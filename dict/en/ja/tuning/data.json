In music, it specifically means adjusting the pitch of instruments to create harmonious sounds. Beyond music, it can describe adjustments to engines, radios, or even abstract concepts like strategies or plans. The term often implies a process of fine adjustment to achieve precision.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The car needs a tune.","correct":"✓ The car needs a tune-up. / ✓ The car needs tuning.","note":"'Tune' is often used informally, but 'tune-up' or 'tuning' is more precise when referring to engine maintenance.

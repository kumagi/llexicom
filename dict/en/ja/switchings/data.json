The verb 'switch' originally meant 'to swap or exchange,' and its etymology traces back to Middle Dutch 'swicken,' meaning 'to yield, move, or give way.' The addition of '-ing' transforms it into a noun describing the action or process of switching.","priority":"★★★"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/ˈswɪtʃɪŋz/","syllables":"switch-ings"},"inflection":{"noun_plural":"switchings"},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Switchings' is primarily used in technical contexts, especially in electrical engineering, telecommunications, and computer networking.

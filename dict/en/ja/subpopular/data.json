It's like saying something is 'less than popular'. You might use it to talk about a type of music or a movie that most people haven't heard of, but that a certain group of people really like. Because it's not a common word, it's more likely to be used in writing or by people with a larger vocabulary."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The artist's subpopular work gained recognition after their death.","translation":"そのアーティストの一般受けしない作品は、死後に評価されるようになった。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"Not widely known"},{"sentence":"They cater to a subpopular market with their handmade goods.","translation":"彼らは手作りの品物でニッチな市場に対応している。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"Niche appeal"},{"sentence":"The subpopular blog gained a loyal following over time.","translation":"そのあまり人気のないブログは、時間をかけて熱心なファンを獲得した。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"Limited popularity"}]}

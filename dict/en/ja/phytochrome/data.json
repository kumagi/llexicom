It acts as a photoreceptor, meaning it senses light and triggers various developmental processes in response. It exists in two main forms: Pr (red light absorbing) and Pfr (far-red light absorbing). The ratio of red to far-red light influences the conversion between these forms, which in turn affects plant growth and development.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Phytochromes are responsible for photosynthesis.","correct":"✓ Phytochromes are responsible for photomorphogenesis.","note":"Phytochromes regulate photomorphogenesis (development in response to light), while chlorophylls are responsible for photosynthesis (energy production from light)."},{"incorrect":"✗ Phytochrome is only found in animals.","correct":"✓ Phytochrome is found in plants, bacteria, and fungi.","note":"Phytochrome is primarily associated with plants, but it is also found in some bacteria and fungi."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["photomorphogenesis","photoreceptor","chlorophyll"],"phrasal_verbs":[],"priority":"★★★"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low Frequency","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"Phytochrome is a specialized term used in plant biology.

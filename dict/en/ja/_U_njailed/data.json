It is formed by adding the prefix \"un-\" to the word \"jailed.\" Because it is not a commonly used word, it is more likely to be encountered in formal or legal contexts. A more common way to express the same idea is to use the words \"released\" or \"freed\" from prison."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The lawyer fought to get his client unjailed.","translation":"弁護士は依頼人を釈放させるために戦った。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"釈放する"},{"sentence":"The unjailed suspect was immediately placed under surveillance.","translation":"釈放された容疑者は直ちに監視下に置かれた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"釈放された"}]}

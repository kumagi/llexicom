It's often used in contexts like audio or image processing to describe the lack of adjustments that would typically improve the quality or balance. The word is formed by adding the prefix 'non-' to 'equalization,' indicating the negation of the process. Understanding this term requires familiarity with the concept of equalization and its applications in various fields."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The audio track suffered from significant noise due to the **nonequalization** during recording.","translation":"そのオーディオトラックは、録音中の非イコライゼーションのために、著しいノイズに悩まされた。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"Audio Processing"},{"sentence":"The **nonequalization** of educational resources contributes to disparities in academic achievement.","translation":"教育資源の不均等化は、学業成績の格差に寄与する。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"General Inequality"}]}

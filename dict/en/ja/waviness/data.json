It's used to describe things that have a wave-like pattern or surface, such as hair, fabric, or even the surface of a lens. The word is formed by adding the suffix '-ness' to the adjective 'wavy', which turns it into a noun. Understanding the word 'waviness' requires a good vocabulary and the ability to understand abstract concepts. It's more likely to be encountered in technical or descriptive contexts."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The **waviness** of the wheat fields created a beautiful scene.","translation":"小麦畑の波打ちが美しい景色を作り出した。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"波状であること"},{"sentence":"The **waviness** in the metal casting caused it to be rejected.","translation":"金属鋳造の波打ちが原因で、それは不採用となった。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"波状であること"},{"sentence":"The **waviness** of the road made the car ride uncomfortable.","translation":"道路の波打ちが車の乗り心地を悪くした。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"波状であること"},{"sentence":"The lens was rejected due to excessive **waviness**.","translation":"そのレンズは、過度の波打ちのために不採用となった。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"(光学) レンズやミラーなどの表面の微細な波状の凹凸"}]}

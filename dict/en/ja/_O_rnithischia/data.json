However, it's important to note that birds did not evolve from ornithischians, but rather from saurischian (lizard-hipped) dinosaurs. This is a classic example of convergent evolution, where similar features evolve independently in different lineages. The group includes a wide variety of herbivorous dinosaurs, often possessing elaborate armor, horns, or frills.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Ornithischia are ancestors of birds.","correct":"✓ Birds are descended from Saurischia, not Ornithischia.","note":"Birds evolved from Saurischian dinosaurs, not Ornithischian dinosaurs, despite the name suggesting otherwise."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["ornithischian (adjective)"],"phrases":["thyreophora","cerapoda","ornithopoda"],"priority":"★★★"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Ornithischia' is a term used in paleontology to classify a group of dinosaurs based on their pelvic structure.

It describes a material, usually a metal alloy, that has been specifically designed to be easily cut and shaped using machine tools. This is achieved by adding elements to the material that help to break the material into small chips during machining, reducing friction and wear on the cutting tools. Understanding this term requires familiarity with manufacturing processes and material science."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The use of free-machining stainless steel significantly reduced production time.","translation":"快削ステンレス鋼の使用により、生産時間が大幅に短縮されました。","type":"example","meaning_category":"general"},{"sentence":"This free-machining brass alloy is ideal for high-volume screw production.","translation":"この快削黄銅合金は、大量のねじ生産に最適です。","type":"example","meaning_category":"specific material"},{"sentence":"Compared to standard steel, free-machining steel offers improved surface finish after machining.","translation":"標準鋼と比較して、快削鋼は機械加工後の表面仕上げが向上しています。","type":"example","meaning_category":"comparison"}]}

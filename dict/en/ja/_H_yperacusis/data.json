It is different from phonophobia, which is a fear of loud sounds. People with hyperacusis may find everyday sounds like running water, chewing, or the rustling of paper to be uncomfortably or even painfully loud. The condition can be caused by a variety of factors, including noise exposure, head injury, Lyme disease, and certain medications. Treatment options may include sound therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, and addressing any underlying medical conditions.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ I have hyperacusis, so I'm afraid of loud noises.","correct":"✓ I have hyperacusis, so loud noises are painful for me.","note":"Hyperacusis is not a fear of loud sounds (that's phonophobia), but rather a condition where sounds are perceived as excessively loud and often painful."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["hyperacusic (adjective)"],"related_terms":["phonophobia (fear of loud sounds)","tinnitus (ringing in the ears)","misophonia (hatred of specific sounds)"],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Hyperacusis' is a technical term referring to an increased sensitivity to sound, causing ordinary noises to seem excessively loud or painful.

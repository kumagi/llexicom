It refers to a specialized suit worn by pilots and astronauts to protect them from the effects of high acceleration forces (G-forces). These forces can cause blood to pool in the lower body, leading to blackouts. The G-suit counteracts this by applying pressure to the legs and abdomen, maintaining blood flow to the brain.

It is often used in the context of software design, data formats, or problem-solving approaches to indicate flexibility and compatibility with a range of different algorithms. The goal is to avoid being tied to a specific algorithmic solution and to allow for easy substitution or adaptation as needed.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The system is algorithm neutral.","correct":"✓ The system is algorithm-neutral.","note":"The correct form is 'algorithm-neutral' with a hyphen."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["neutrality"],"phrases":["algorithm","neutral"]},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Algorithm-neutral' is a technical term used in computer science and software engineering. It describes a system, design, or approach that is not specific to any particular algorithm. This means it can work with different algorithms or be easily adapted to new ones. It's important in fields where flexibility and adaptability are key, allowing for changes in algorithms without requiring major overhauls of the entire system."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The company adopted an **algorithm-neutral** strategy to ensure compatibility with future technologies.","translation":"その会社は、将来のテクノロジーとの互換性を確保するために、アルゴリズムに依存しない戦略を採用しました。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"General"},{"sentence":"An **algorithm-neutral** data storage solution allows for easy migration to different data processing systems.","translation":"アルゴリズムに依存しないデータストレージソリューションにより、異なるデータ処理システムへの簡単な移行が可能になります。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"Data Storage"},{"sentence":"The proposed model aims to be **algorithm-neutral**, making it applicable across various domains.","translation":"提案されたモデルは、アルゴリズムに依存しないことを目指しており、さまざまな分野に適用できます。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"Model Design"}]}

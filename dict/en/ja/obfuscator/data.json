Imagine someone trying to read a secret message where the words have been rearranged and replaced with symbols. An obfuscator does something similar to code, making it harder for others to steal or copy the software's ideas. While it doesn't completely prevent reverse engineering, it adds a layer of protection. The term can also be used more generally to describe anything that makes something unclear or confusing."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The company used a strong JavaScript obfuscator to protect their web application's logic.","translation":"会社は、Webアプリケーションのロジックを保護するために、強力なJavaScript難読化ツールを使用しました。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"プログラミングツール"},{"sentence":"The lawyer's long and convoluted explanation acted as an obfuscator, confusing the jury.","translation":"弁護士の長くて入り組んだ説明は、陪審員を混乱させる曖昧化するものとして機能しました。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"曖昧にするもの"}]}

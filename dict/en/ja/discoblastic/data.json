In biology, it refers to a specific type of cleavage (cell division) in eggs with a large amount of yolk, where the cleavage is partial and forms a disc of cells. In geology, it describes a rock texture where crystals are arranged in a disc-like pattern. Due to its specialized nature, it's not commonly used in everyday language.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The discoblastic personality of the rock...","correct":"✓ The discoblastic texture of the rock...","note":"'Discoblastic' in geology refers to texture, not personality or other attributes.

It's often used in healthcare, social work, and disability studies. The term aims to be more descriptive and less stigmatizing than older terms like 'disabled' or 'handicapped', by focusing on the functional limitations rather than the condition itself. However, some people with disabilities prefer identity-first language (e.g., 'disabled person') rather than person-first language (e.g., 'person with a disability' or 'functionally-impaired person').","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ He is a functionally-impaired.","correct":"✓ He is functionally-impaired. / ✓ He is a functionally-impaired individual.","note":"'Functionally-impaired' is an adjective, so it needs to modify a noun.

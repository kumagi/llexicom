It means to reduce the strength or amplitude of a signal or sound to an excessive degree. Understanding this word requires familiarity with the concept of attenuation, which is the controlled reduction of something's intensity. Therefore, it's a word more likely to be encountered in specialized or technical contexts rather than general conversation."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The engineer realized he had **overattenuated** the bass frequencies, resulting in a thin sound.","translation":"エンジニアは低音域を過度に減衰させてしまったことに気づき、薄い音になってしまった。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"過度に減衰させる"},{"sentence":"If the signal **overattenuates**, it may become undetectable by the receiver.","translation":"信号が過度に減衰すると、受信機で検出できなくなる可能性がある。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"過度に減衰する"}]}

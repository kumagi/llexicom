In general use, it means something can be satisfied, like hunger or a request. In logic, particularly in the context of Boolean logic and the SAT problem, it has a more technical meaning: a formula is satisfiable if there exists an assignment of truth values to its variables that makes the entire formula true.

In everyday language, it means that a need or desire can be met. For example, \"His hunger was satisfiable with a sandwich.\" In a more technical context, especially in computer science and logic, \"satisfiable\" means that a statement or formula can be made true by assigning certain values to its variables.

RNases are ubiquitous and can quickly degrade RNA, making them a significant concern in molecular biology experiments involving RNA. Common methods for RNase decontamination include autoclaving, treatment with chemicals like DEPC (diethylpyrocarbonate), or using commercially available RNase removal products.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The RNase-decontaminated is important for RNA experiments.","correct":"✓ RNase-decontaminated materials are important for RNA experiments.","note":"'RNase-decontaminated' is an adjective and needs to modify a noun."},{"incorrect":"✗ RNase decontaminated the water.","correct":"✓ The water was RNase-decontaminated.","note":"'RNase-decontaminated' is an adjective, not a verb.

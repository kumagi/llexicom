This term is often used in technical fields like math, science, and engineering to describe data or equations that have been simplified for easier analysis or calculation. For example, a complex curve might be 'linearised' over a small range to approximate it with a straight line. Understanding this term requires some familiarity with these technical contexts."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The model was linearised around the operating point.","translation":"そのモデルは動作点の周りで線形化されました。","type":"verb (past participle)","meaning_category":"線形化された"},{"sentence":"The linearised equations provided a good approximation of the system's behavior.","translation":"線形化された方程式は、システムの挙動の良い近似を提供しました。","type":"verb (past participle)","meaning_category":"線形化された"}]}

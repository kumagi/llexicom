It involves creating a new object from a class, effectively replacing a previously existing object of the same class. This is often done to reset the object's state or to free up resources associated with the old object. It's important to distinguish reinstantiation from simply modifying the state of an existing object. Reinstantiation involves the creation of a completely new object in memory.","priority":"High"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The reinstantiation was done by mistake, and the object lost its data.","correct":"✓ The object was reinstantiated by mistake, and the object lost its data.","note":"It's important to use the term correctly in context.

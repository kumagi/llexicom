It describes a pattern of growth that starts slowly, accelerates rapidly, and then slows down as it approaches a limit. This is often used to model the adoption of new technologies, product life cycles, and organizational growth.\n\n2.  **Road/Track Feature:** This refers to a physical feature on a road or track where there are two consecutive sharp turns in opposite directions.

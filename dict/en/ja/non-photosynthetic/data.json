This means they cannot use sunlight to create their own food. Instead, they get their energy and nutrients from other sources, like consuming other organisms or using chemical reactions. This term is often used in biology and botany when discussing different types of organisms and their methods of obtaining energy. It implies a higher level of scientific understanding.

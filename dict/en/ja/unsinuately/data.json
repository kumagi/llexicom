It's the opposite of 'sinuously,' which means 'winding' or 'curving.' Because it's not a common word, it's more likely to be encountered in formal writing or technical contexts where precise descriptions of direction or movement are needed. It is formed by adding the prefix 'un-' (meaning 'not') to 'sinuately,' which itself is derived from 'sinuous' (having many curves)."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The tunnel stretched unsinuately for miles beneath the city.","translation":"トンネルは街の下を何マイルもまっすぐに伸びていた。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"まっすぐに"},{"sentence":"The arrow flew unsinuately towards the target.","translation":"矢は標的に向かってまっすぐに飛んだ。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"まっすぐに"},{"sentence":"The engineer designed the pipeline to run unsinuately across the plain.","translation":"技師はパイプラインを平原をまっすぐに横切るように設計した。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"まっすぐに"}]}

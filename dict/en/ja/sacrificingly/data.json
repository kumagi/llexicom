'Sacrificing' is derived from the verb 'sacrifice', which comes from the Latin 'sacrificium' (a sacrifice), from 'sacer' (sacred) and 'facere' (to make). Thus, 'sacrificingly' literally means 'in a manner of making something sacred' or 'in a manner of offering something up'.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/ˌsækrɪˈfaɪsɪŋli/","syllables":"sac-ri-fic-ing-ly"},"inflection":{"notes":"As an adverb, 'sacrificingly' does not have different forms for gender or number."},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Sacrificingly' describes actions performed with a willingness to give up something valued for the sake of others or a greater cause. It implies a conscious decision to endure hardship or loss. It is often used to describe acts of love, devotion, or charity. The word suggests a high degree of commitment and selflessness.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ She lived sacrificingly.","correct":"✓ She lived a life of sacrifice. / ✓ She lived sacrificingly.","note":"While 'sacrificingly' is a valid adverb, sometimes rephrasing the sentence to use a noun phrase like 'a life of sacrifice' can sound more natural, depending on the context. Both are grammatically correct. However, using the adverb 'sacrificingly' is perfectly acceptable and common. The mistake would be to use it incorrectly in a sentence where it doesn't logically fit. For example, 'He ate sacrificingly' doesn't make sense unless he's giving up some of his food for someone else. "},{"incorrect":"✗ He sacrificingly for his family.","correct":"✓ He sacrificed for his family. / ✓ He worked sacrificingly for his family.","note":"'Sacrificingly' is an adverb and modifies a verb. The verb 'sacrifice' means to give up something. 'Sacrificingly' describes *how* the action is performed. You can't 'sacrificingly' *for* someone. You sacrifice *something* or you sacrifice *by doing something*. You can, however, *work sacrificingly* for someone."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["sacrifice (noun, verb)","sacrificial (adjective)","sacrificing (adjective, present participle)"],"phrasal_verbs":[],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Sacrificingly' is an adverb that describes doing something in a way that involves giving up something important or valuable.

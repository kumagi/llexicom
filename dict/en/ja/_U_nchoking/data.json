It is a term primarily used in medical or first-aid contexts. The word is formed by adding the prefix 'un-' to 'choking,' indicating the reversal of the choking action. It is often used as a gerund (verbal noun) or present participle, describing the action itself, or as an adjective to describe devices or procedures related to this action. Understanding this term is crucial in emergency situations where someone is choking and requires immediate assistance."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"She demonstrated the proper unchoking technique on the mannequin.","translation":"彼女はマネキンを使って適切な窒息除去技術を実演しました。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"窒息を取り除くこと"},{"sentence":"The unchoking device is designed for single-handed use.","translation":"その窒息除去装置は片手で使用できるように設計されています。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"窒息を取り除く"},{"sentence":"Unchoking a child requires a gentler approach.","translation":"子供の窒息を取り除くには、より穏やかなアプローチが必要です。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"窒息を取り除くこと"}]}

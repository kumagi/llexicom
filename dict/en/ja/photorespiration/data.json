This process is less efficient than photosynthesis because it consumes energy and releases carbon dioxide, effectively undoing some of the carbon fixation achieved during photosynthesis. Photorespiration is more likely to occur under hot and dry conditions when plants close their stomata to conserve water, leading to a buildup of oxygen and a decrease in carbon dioxide within the leaves. C4 plants have evolved mechanisms to minimize photorespiration by concentrating carbon dioxide in specialized cells.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Photorespiration is the same as photosynthesis.","correct":"✓ Photorespiration is different from photosynthesis.","note":"Photorespiration and photosynthesis are distinct processes with opposite effects on carbon fixation."},{"incorrect":"✗ Photorespiration increases plant growth.","correct":"✓ Photorespiration decreases plant growth.","note":"Photorespiration reduces the efficiency of photosynthesis and thus decreases plant growth."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["photorespiratory"],"phrasal_verbs":[]},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C1","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Photorespiration' is a technical term in plant biology, referring to a metabolic pathway that reduces the efficiency of photosynthesis.

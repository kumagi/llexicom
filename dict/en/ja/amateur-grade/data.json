It's a way of saying something isn't very polished or skilled. Think of a video made by someone who's just starting out, or a website that looks like it was made by someone who doesn't know much about web design. It's not necessarily an insult, but it's not a compliment either. It simply describes the level of skill or quality.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The sound quality of the recording was amateur-grade, but the band's energy shone through.","translation":"録音の音質は素人レベルだったが、バンドのエネルギーは伝わってきた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"素人レベルの品質"},{"sentence":"The special effects in the student film were amateur-grade.","translation":"学生映画の特殊効果は素人レベルだった。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"素人が作った"},{"sentence":"Despite the amateur-grade equipment, they managed to capture some stunning footage.","translation":"素人レベルの機材にもかかわらず、彼らは見事な映像を捉えることができた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"素人レベルの品質"}]}

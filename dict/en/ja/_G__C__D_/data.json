It is the largest positive integer that divides two or more integers without leaving a remainder.

The terms 'Greatest Common Factor' (GCF) and 'Highest Common Factor' (HCF) are often used interchangeably with GCD.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The GCD is the smallest number that divides both.","correct":"✓ The GCD is the largest number that divides both.","note":"GCD stands for Greatest Common Divisor, so it's the largest, not the smallest, common divisor."},{"incorrect":"✗ GCD can only be found for two numbers.","correct":"✓ GCD can be found for two or more numbers.","note":"GCD can be calculated for more than two numbers, although the process might involve finding the GCD of pairs of numbers iteratively."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":[],"related_concepts":["LCM (Least Common Multiple)","Relatively prime (coprime)","Divisibility","Factorization"],"priority":"★★★"},"level_frequency":{"domain":"Mathematics","level":"Intermediate","frequency_google_ngram":"Relatively infrequent outside of mathematical contexts.","priority":"★★☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"Intermediate","text":"GCD stands for Greatest Common Divisor. It's the biggest number that can divide two or more numbers exactly (without any remainder). For example, if you have the numbers 12 and 18, the GCD is 6 because 6 is the largest number that divides both 12 and 18. You can use the GCD to simplify fractions or solve other math problems. There's also a method called the Euclidean algorithm that helps you find the GCD.","priority":"★★★"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The **GCD** of 24 and 36 is 12.","translation":"24と36の**GCD**（最大公約数）は12です。","type":"definition","meaning_category":"Mathematics"},{"sentence":"To simplify the fraction 24/36, we can divide both numerator and denominator by their **GCD**, which is 12.","translation":"分数24/36を単純化するには、分子と分母をそれらの**GCD**（最大公約数）である12で割ることができます。","type":"application","meaning_category":"Mathematics"},{"sentence":"The Euclidean algorithm provides an efficient way to compute the **GCD** of two integers.","translation":"ユークリッドの互除法は、2つの整数の**GCD**（最大公約数）を計算するための効率的な方法を提供します。","type":"algorithm","meaning_category":"Mathematics"}]}

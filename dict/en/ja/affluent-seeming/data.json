It's more nuanced than simply saying something is 'affluent' because it implies that the wealth is only apparent or perceived, not necessarily confirmed. This word is useful for describing situations where the outward appearance of wealth is important or noteworthy, even if the actual financial status is uncertain. It is more commonly used in formal writing or speech."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The hotel attracted an affluent-seeming clientele with its luxurious amenities.","translation":"そのホテルは豪華な設備で裕福に見える顧客層を魅了した。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"appearing wealthy"},{"sentence":"The affluent-seeming facade of the building hid the dilapidated interior.","translation":"その建物の裕福に見える外観は、荒廃した内部を隠していた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"appearing wealthy"},{"sentence":"Despite his affluent-seeming lifestyle, he was deeply in debt.","translation":"彼の裕福に見えるライフスタイルにもかかわらず、彼は深い借金を抱えていた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"appearing wealthy"}]}

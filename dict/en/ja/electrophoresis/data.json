It relies on the principle that charged molecules will move through a medium when an electric field is applied. The rate of migration depends on the charge, size, and shape of the molecule, as well as the strength of the electric field and the properties of the medium. Different types of electrophoresis exist, each optimized for specific applications.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ electroforesis","correct":"✓ electrophoresis","note":"The correct spelling includes the 'ph' after 'electro-'."},{"incorrect":"✗ I did a electroforesis.","correct":"✓ I did an electrophoresis.","note":"'Electrophoresis' starts with a vowel sound, so use the indefinite article 'an'."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["electrophoretic (adjective)","electropherogram (noun)"],"related_terms":["isoelectric focusing","Western blotting","Southern blotting","Northern blotting"],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"frequency_google_ngram":"Relatively low frequency, primarily used in scientific contexts.","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"Electrophoresis is a scientific term referring to a laboratory technique used to separate molecules based on their size and electrical charge.

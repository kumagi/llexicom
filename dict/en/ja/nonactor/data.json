The word is not very common, so familiarity with the prefix 'non-' is helpful in understanding its meaning.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The director chose a local fisherman, a complete nonactor, for the lead role.","translation":"監督は、主役に地元の漁師を選んだ。彼は全くの俳優経験者ではなかった。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"俳優でない人"},{"sentence":"In this political crisis, the international community remained largely a nonactor.","translation":"この政治危機において、国際社会はほとんど傍観者の立場にとどまった。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"行動しない人"}]}

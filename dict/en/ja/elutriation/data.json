It involves suspending a mixture of particles in a fluid (usually water or air) and allowing the fluid to flow upwards. The upward flow of the fluid opposes the force of gravity, causing the particles to separate based on their settling velocities. Smaller, less dense particles are carried upwards with the fluid, while larger, denser particles settle downwards. The process is often used in mineral processing, soil science, and environmental science.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Elutriation is used for mixing particles.","correct":"✓ Elutriation is used for separating particles.","note":"Elutriation is a separation technique, not a mixing technique."},{"incorrect":"✗ Elutriation only works with dry particles.","correct":"✓ Elutriation works with particles suspended in a fluid (usually water or air).","note":"Elutriation requires a fluid medium to separate particles."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["elutriate (verb: to separate by elutriation)","elutriator (noun: an apparatus used for elutriation)"],"phrasal_verbs":[],"priority":"★☆☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"非常に低頻度 (Very low frequency) - 専門用語","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"Elutriation is a specialized term in chemistry and engineering referring to a process that separates particles based on size, shape, and density using a fluid stream.

It's not simply the absence of smell, but rather the perception of odors that aren't there or the misperception of existing smells. It's often associated with neurological issues or head trauma, making it a term more commonly found in medical contexts. Understanding the distinction between pseudosmia and other olfactory disorders like anosmia (loss of smell) is crucial for accurate communication in healthcare settings."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"Following the sinus infection, she developed pseudosmia, and everything smelled like burnt toast.","translation":"副鼻腔炎の後、彼女は錯嗅を発症し、すべてのものが焦げたトーストのような臭いがした。","type":"general","meaning_category":"錯嗅の症状"},{"sentence":"The neurologist investigated whether the patient's reports of strange smells were due to pseudosmia or another condition.","translation":"神経科医は、患者の奇妙な臭いの訴えが錯嗅によるものか、別の状態によるものかを調査した。","type":"medical","meaning_category":"医学的診断"}]}

It's like taking a 'mole,' which is already a standard unit, and dividing it into a thousand tiny pieces. You'll mostly see this word in science textbooks or medical reports when they talk about the amount of something in a liquid, like blood. It's a precise way to describe how much of a certain substance is present.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The lab results showed a calcium concentration of 2.2 millimoles per liter.","translation":"検査結果は、カルシウム濃度が2.2ミリモル/リットルであることを示しました。","type":"general","meaning_category":"concentration"},{"sentence":"We need to add 0.5 millimoles of the reagent to the solution.","translation":"試薬を0.5ミリモル溶液に加える必要があります。","type":"chemistry","meaning_category":"chemistry"},{"sentence":"The patient's sodium level was slightly below the normal range of 135-145 millimoles per liter.","translation":"患者のナトリウムレベルは、正常範囲の135〜145ミリモル/リットルをわずかに下回っていました。","type":"medical","meaning_category":"medical"}]}

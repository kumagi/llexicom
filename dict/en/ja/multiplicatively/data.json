'Multiply' comes from the Latin word 'multiplicare,' meaning 'to increase in number.' The suffix '-ly' is added to 'multiplicative' to form the adverb 'multiplicatively.'","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/ˌmʌltɪplɪˈkeɪtɪvli/","syllables":"mul-ti-pli-ca-tive-ly"},"inflection":{"notes":"As an adverb, 'multiplicatively' does not have different inflections."},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Multiplicatively' describes a relationship or process where quantities are combined through multiplication rather than addition. It often implies that the effect of combining the quantities is greater than the sum of their individual effects. This is in contrast to 'additively,' where the combined effect is simply the sum of the individual effects. It is used in mathematics, statistics, economics, and other fields where quantitative relationships are analyzed.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The factors increased additive, not multiplicatively.","correct":"✓ The factors increased additively, not multiplicatively.","note":"Ensure correct adverb form is used.

It is most likely to be encountered in written texts, particularly those that are academic or professional in nature. The word is formed by adding the suffix '-ness' to the adjective 'observant', which means 'quick to notice things'. Therefore, 'observantness' refers to the quality of being observant, or the degree to which someone is good at noticing details. Because of its formality and relative infrequency, it is more likely to be used by advanced English speakers and writers."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The scientist's **observantness** allowed her to identify the key factor in the experiment.","translation":"科学者の観察力によって、実験の重要な要素を特定することができた。","type":"general","meaning_category":"observation"},{"sentence":"His **observantness** of human behavior made him a great writer.","translation":"彼の人間行動に対する観察力は、彼を偉大な作家にした。","type":"general","meaning_category":"observation"},{"sentence":"Due to her **observantness**, she noticed the subtle clues that led to the solution.","translation":"彼女の観察力のおかげで、解決につながる微妙な手がかりに気づいた。","type":"general","meaning_category":"observation"}]}

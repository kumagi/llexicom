It describes systems that are linked to a photovoltaic power source, typically a solar panel array, and are often connected to a larger electrical grid. This allows excess energy generated by the PV system to be fed back into the grid, and allows the system to draw power from the grid when the PV system is not generating enough energy.","priority":"☆☆☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The photovoltaic-connect system is efficient.","correct":"✓ The photovoltaic-connected system is efficient.","note":"Ensure the correct spelling of 'connected' with the '-ed' ending."}],"priority":"☆☆☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["photovoltaic (adjective, noun)","connected (adjective)","connection (noun)"],"phrasal_verbs":[],"related_terms":["grid-connected","solar power","renewable energy","PV system","inverter","electrical grid"]},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C1","frequency_google_ngram":"Low","priority":"☆☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Photovoltaic-connected' is a technical term used in the context of solar energy and electrical systems.

It implies a competitive or exaggerated display of pity, suggesting that one person is trying to show more pity than another. Due to its infrequent use, it may not be readily understood without context. It is more likely to be encountered in literary or rhetorical contexts where the author is aiming for a specific effect. Understanding the root words \"out-\" and \"pity\" is essential for grasping its meaning.

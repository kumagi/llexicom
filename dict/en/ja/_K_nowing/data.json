First, as an adjective, it describes someone who seems to have secret information or understanding that others don't. For example, 'a knowing smile' suggests the person is aware of something others are not. Second, it can be used as a gerund or present participle of the verb 'know,' referring to the act of knowing something. It's important to distinguish between these uses and to avoid confusing 'knowing' with 'knowledgeable,' which means having a lot of knowledge."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"She cast a **knowing** glance at her friend across the room.","translation":"彼女は部屋の向こうにいる友人に意味ありげな視線を送った。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"示唆的な"},{"sentence":"**Knowing** the risks, he proceeded with caution.","translation":"リスクを知っていたので、彼は慎重に進んだ。","type":"verb (gerund)","meaning_category":"知ること"},{"sentence":"The detective had a **knowing** look in his eyes, as if he already knew the culprit.","translation":"刑事はまるで犯人をすでに知っているかのような、意味ありげな目をしていた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"意味ありげな"},{"sentence":"**Knowing** the local language is a great advantage when traveling.","translation":"旅行する際、現地の言語を知っていることは大きな利点だ。","type":"verb (gerund)","meaning_category":"知ること"}]}

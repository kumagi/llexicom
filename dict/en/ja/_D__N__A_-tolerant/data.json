It describes organisms, cells, or mechanisms that possess an enhanced ability to cope with DNA damage or unusual DNA structures. This tolerance can arise from efficient DNA repair mechanisms, alternative replication strategies, or other compensatory processes. The term is often used to characterize organisms that thrive in environments with high levels of DNA-damaging agents, such as radiation or certain chemicals.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The virus is DNA tolerant to antibiotics.","correct":"✓ The virus is resistant to antibiotics. / ✓ The virus is DNA-tolerant, allowing it to survive DNA damage from certain treatments.","note":"DNA tolerance refers specifically to the ability to withstand DNA damage, not resistance to antibiotics.

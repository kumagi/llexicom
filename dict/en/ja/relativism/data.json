It asserts that knowledge, truth, and morality are relative to particular frameworks, such as individual perspectives, cultural contexts, or historical periods. Different forms of relativism exist, including cultural relativism (which emphasizes the diversity of cultural values), ethical relativism (which denies universal moral principles), and cognitive relativism (which suggests that cognitive processes vary across cultures). Relativism is often contrasted with absolutism, universalism, and objectivism, which posit the existence of objective standards of judgment.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Relativism means everything is true.","correct":"✓ Relativism means that truth is relative to a particular perspective or context.","note":"Relativism does not necessarily imply that everything is true, but rather that truth is not absolute and depends on the framework of reference."},{"incorrect":"✗ Relativism is the same as tolerance.","correct":"✓ While relativism can promote tolerance by recognizing the validity of different perspectives, it is not identical to tolerance.","note":"Relativism is a philosophical position about the nature of truth and knowledge, while tolerance is a value or attitude of respecting others' beliefs and practices."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["relative (adjective, noun)","relativity (noun)","relativist (noun, adjective)","relativistic (adjective)"],"related_concepts":["subjectivity","perspective","context","culture","morality","ethics","epistemology"],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"level":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Relatively low frequency, primarily used in academic and philosophical contexts.","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Relativism' is a complex philosophical term that suggests that truth, knowledge, and morality are not absolute but depend on individual perspectives, cultural contexts, or historical periods. It's often used in discussions about ethics, culture, and knowledge. The idea is that there are no universal standards that apply to everyone, everywhere. Understanding this term requires some familiarity with philosophical concepts and critical thinking. It's important to distinguish between different types of relativism, such as cultural relativism and ethical relativism, and to consider the implications of relativism for issues like tolerance and cross-cultural understanding."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The anthropologist approached the study of the tribe with a commitment to cultural **relativism**.","translation":"その人類学者は、文化相対主義へのコミットメントを持ってその部族の研究に取り組んだ。","type":"general","meaning_category":"General"},{"sentence":"Critics argue that moral **relativism** can lead to a lack of accountability for harmful actions.","translation":"批評家たちは、道徳的相対主義が有害な行為に対する責任の欠如につながる可能性があると主張する。","type":"ethical","meaning_category":"Ethical"},{"sentence":"The debate over truth and **relativism** continues to be a central topic in contemporary philosophy.","translation":"真実と相対主義に関する議論は、現代哲学の中心的なトピックであり続けている。","type":"philosophical","meaning_category":"Philosophical"}]}

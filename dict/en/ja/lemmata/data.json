'Lemma' comes from the Ancient Greek word 'λῆμμα' (lêmma) meaning 'anything received, a premise', from 'λαμβάνω' (lambánō) meaning 'I take, receive, grasp'.

It refers to the base or dictionary form of a word, used to group together all its inflected forms. For example, the lemmata for the words 'go', 'went', 'gone', and 'going' is 'go'. It's important to distinguish between 'lemmata' and 'word forms'; a lemma is an abstract concept, while a word form is a concrete realization of that concept in text or speech.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The lemma of these words are...","correct":"✓ The lemma of these words is...","note":"When referring to the lemma *of* multiple words, the subject is still 'lemma' (singular), so the verb should be singular ('is')."},{"incorrect":"✗ The lemmata is...","correct":"✓ The lemmata are...","note":"'Lemmata' is plural, so it takes a plural verb ('are')."},{"incorrect":"✗ Use lemma instead of lemmata when referring to multiple words.","correct":"✓ Use lemmata, the plural form of lemma, when referring to multiple words.","note":"Lemmata is the correct plural form."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["lemma","lemmatization","lemmatise (British English)","lemmatize (American English)"],"phrasal_verbs":[],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency - primarily used in academic and technical contexts.","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Lemmata' is a term mainly used by people who study language or make dictionaries. It means the main or basic form of a word that you would find in a dictionary. For example, if you look up 'went' in a dictionary, you'll find it under the main word 'go'. So, 'go' is the lemma for 'went'. 'Lemmata' is just the plural form, meaning there are many of these main words.

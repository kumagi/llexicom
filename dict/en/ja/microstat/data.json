It is similar to a chemostat, but often used for smaller culture volumes or more specialized applications. The key feature of a microstat is its ability to maintain a steady state in the culture, where the growth rate and nutrient concentration remain constant over time. This is achieved by continuously adding fresh medium containing essential nutrients and removing spent medium containing waste products and excess cells. By controlling the flow rate of the medium, researchers can precisely manipulate the growth environment and study the effects of different factors on microbial growth and metabolism.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The microstat was used to batch culture the bacteria.","correct":"✓ The microstat was used to continuously culture the bacteria.","note":"Microstats are used for continuous culture, not batch culture."},{"incorrect":"✗ The microstat measures the size of microorganisms.","correct":"✓ The microstat maintains a constant culture volume.","note":"The microstat maintains a constant culture volume, it does not measure the size of microorganisms."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["microstatic (adjective)"],"phrasal_verbs":[]},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"The term 'microstat' refers to a specialized piece of laboratory equipment used in microbiology. It's a type of bioreactor that maintains a constant volume of microbial culture by continuously adding fresh nutrients and removing waste products. This allows for precise control over the growth environment, making it useful for studying microbial physiology and optimizing bioprocesses. The concept is similar to a chemostat, but often applied to smaller-scale cultures or specific research needs. Understanding the function of a microstat requires some background knowledge in microbiology and bioprocessing.","example_sentences":[]},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The researchers used a microstat to study the effects of different nutrient concentrations on bacterial growth.","translation":"研究者らは、さまざまな栄養濃度が細菌の増殖に及ぼす影響を調べるためにマイクロスタットを使用した。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"device for maintaining constant culture volume"}]}

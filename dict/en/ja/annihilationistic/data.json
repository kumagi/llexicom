It describes something related to the belief that existence can be completely destroyed, either in the sense of the soul ceasing to exist after death (religious annihilationism) or in a broader, more philosophical sense of complete obliteration or meaninglessness. It often carries a negative connotation, suggesting a bleak or pessimistic outlook.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The annihilationistic terrorist group aimed to reform the government.","correct":"✓ The annihilationistic terrorist group aimed to destroy the government.","note":"\"Annihilationistic\" implies destruction, not reform.

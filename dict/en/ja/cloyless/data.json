'Cloy' itself comes from the Old French word 'encloyer', meaning 'to nail up, block, or prick', which evolved to mean 'to glut or satiate'. Thus, 'cloyless' literally means 'without the quality of cloying' or 'not causing satiety'.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/ˈklɔɪləs/","syllables":"cloy-less"},"inflection":{"adjective_forms":{"comparative":"more cloyless","superlative":"most cloyless"}},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Cloyless' is a relatively uncommon word, primarily used in literary or descriptive contexts to emphasize the absence of an unpleasant excess or surfeit.

It's used to describe things that could be overwhelming, like very sweet desserts or overly charming people, but that are actually enjoyable because they don't have that negative quality. Think of it as the opposite of something that's 'too much.' It's more common in writing than in everyday conversation.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The wine's cloyless finish left a pleasant aftertaste.","translation":"そのワインの飽きさせない後味は、心地よい余韻を残した。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"飽きさせない"},{"sentence":"Her cloyless enthusiasm was infectious, never becoming tiresome.","translation":"彼女の飽きさせない熱意は伝染しやすく、決してうんざりさせることはなかった。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"飽きさせない"},{"sentence":"The author's cloyless prose made the novel a joy to read.","translation":"その作家のしつこくない散文は、小説を読むのを楽しいものにした。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"飽きさせない"}]}

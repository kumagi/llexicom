'Commodity' comes from the French word 'commodité,' meaning 'convenience, advantage,' and ultimately from the Latin word 'commoditas,' meaning 'suitability, convenience, advantage.' The suffix '-fy' means 'to make' or 'to cause to become.' Therefore, 'to commodify' means 'to make into a commodity.'","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/kəˈmɒdɪfaɪɪŋ/","syllables":"co-mod-i-fy-ing"},"inflection":{"verb_forms":{"present_simple":["commodifies"],"past_simple":"commodified","past_participle":"commodified","present_participle":"commodifying"}},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Commodify' and its related forms (commodification, commodifying, etc.) are often used in critical contexts, particularly in discussions of economics, sociology, and cultural studies.

It's often used when something that wasn't originally seen as having a monetary value is now being treated as a commodity. For example, if someone says 'They are commodifying water,' it means they are treating water as a product to be bought and sold, rather than a basic human right. This term is often used in discussions about economics, politics, and society, and it can have negative connotations, suggesting that something important is being reduced to its financial value."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The company is being accused of **commodifying** personal relationships through its dating app.","translation":"その会社は、出会い系アプリを通じて個人的な関係を商品化していると非難されている。","type":"verb (present participle)","meaning_category":"商品化すること"},{"sentence":"The **commodifying** of natural resources has led to environmental degradation.","translation":"天然資源の商品化は、環境破壊につながっている。","type":"verb (gerund)","meaning_category":"商品化すること"},{"sentence":"Are we **commodifying** childhood by marketing adult products to children?","translation":"大人の製品を子供向けに販売することで、私たちは子供時代を商品化しているのだろうか？","type":"verb (present participle)","meaning_category":"商品化すること"}]}

The consequences of being RNA-deficient can vary depending on the specific context, but often include impaired protein synthesis, altered gene expression, and developmental abnormalities.","priority":"N/A"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The cells were RNA deficient.","correct":"✓ The cells were RNA-deficient.","note":"Hyphenation is standard when using \"deficient\" as a suffix to describe a lack of something."}],"priority":"N/A"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["deficiency"],"related_terms":["RNA","DNA-deficient","protein-deficient"]},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"N/A","frequency_google_ngram":"Low","priority":"N/A"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"\"RNA-deficient\" is a technical term used in biology.

It involves using a chemical called Nessler's reagent, which reacts with ammonia to create a color change. The intensity of the color indicates how much ammonia is present. This method is often used in water quality testing.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The lab technician performed nesslerization on the wastewater sample.","translation":"実験技師は排水サンプルに対してネスラー化を行った。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"比色定量法"},{"sentence":"Nesslerization provides a quick and easy way to estimate ammonia levels.","translation":"ネスラー化はアンモニアレベルを推定するための迅速かつ簡単な方法を提供する。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"比色定量法"}]}

It refers to someone who teaches, particularly in a religious context, using a question-and-answer method. Understanding this word requires familiarity with the concept of 'catechism', which is a summary of religious doctrine in question-and-answer form. While the word can also refer to anyone who questions rigorously, this usage is less common. Therefore, this word is more likely to be encountered in religious or academic contexts."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"As a dedicated catechizer, she spent hours preparing lessons for her students.","translation":"熱心な教理問答者として、彼女は生徒たちのために何時間もレッスンを準備した。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"教理を教える人"},{"sentence":"The lawyer's approach was that of a relentless catechizer, pressing the witness for every detail.","translation":"弁護士のアプローチは、容赦ない質問者のそれであり、証人にすべての詳細を求めた。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"質問者"}]}

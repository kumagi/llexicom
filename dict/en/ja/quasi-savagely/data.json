It suggests a behavior that is wild, uncontrolled, or ferocious to some degree, but not entirely so. The prefix \"quasi-\" indicates that the action only resembles savagery, without fully embodying it. Because of its nuanced meaning and relatively low frequency, it is more likely to be encountered in advanced or literary contexts."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The starving refugees descended on the aid supplies quasi-savagely.","translation":"飢えた難民たちは、ほとんど野蛮な様子で救援物資に群がった。","type":"general","meaning_category":"manner"},{"sentence":"The politician attacked his opponent's policies quasi-savagely during the debate.","translation":"その政治家は討論中、ほとんど野蛮な様子で対立候補の政策を攻撃した。","type":"general","meaning_category":"manner"},{"sentence":"The children fought over the last piece of candy quasi-savagely.","translation":"子供たちは最後の一つのキャンディーを巡って、ほとんど野蛮な様子で争った。","type":"general","meaning_category":"manner"}]}

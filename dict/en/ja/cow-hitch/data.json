It's a relatively simple knot to tie, consisting of two half hitches made in succession. However, it's not the most secure knot for heavy loads, as it can be prone to slipping. Therefore, it's more suitable for temporary attachments or lighter applications. The term itself is likely derived from its historical use in securing livestock. While not a common term in everyday conversation, it's relevant in contexts involving ropework, sailing, climbing, or other outdoor activities.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The scout leader showed the children how to tie a **cow-hitch**.","translation":"スカウトのリーダーは子供たちにカウヒッチの結び方を教えた。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"knot"},{"sentence":"**Cow-hitch** the rope around the pole to secure the tent.","translation":"ポールにロープをカウヒッチで結びつけてテントを固定しなさい。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"tie"},{"sentence":"A **cow-hitch** is a quick and easy way to attach a rope to a ring.","translation":"カウヒッチはロープをリングに素早く簡単に取り付ける方法です。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"knot"},{"sentence":"He **cow-hitched** the hammock to the tree.","translation":"彼はハンモックを木にカウヒッチで結びつけた。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"tie"}]}

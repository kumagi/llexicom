The degree of involvement can vary from casual participation to deep immersion. It's often used to describe becoming actively engaged in something, taking on responsibilities, or becoming emotionally invested. The reflexive pronoun 'se' is essential, as it indicates that the subject is acting upon themselves. The verb 'involucrar' (without 'se') means 'to involve' someone else.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"Quiero involucrar en el proyecto.","correct":"Quiero involucrarme en el proyecto.","note":"The reflexive pronoun 'me' is needed because you are involving *yourself*."},{"incorrect":"No se involucrar en eso.","correct":"No te involucres en eso.","note":"The correct conjugation of the reflexive pronoun 'te' is needed for the 'tú' form of the imperative."},{"incorrect":"Estoy involucrado en el problema.","correct":"Me he involucrado en el problema.","note":"'Estoy involucrado' means 'I am involved' as a state, whereas 'Me he involucrado' means 'I have gotten involved' as an action."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["involucrado/a (adjective: involved)","involucramiento (noun: involvement)","involucrar (verb: to involve)"],"phrases":["involucrarse hasta el cuello (to get in over one's head)","involucrarse de lleno (to get fully involved)"],"priority":"★★★"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"B1","frequency_corpus":"Common in spoken and written Spanish.","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"B1","text":"'Involucrarse' means to participate actively in something, to become part of a situation, or to commit oneself to an activity.

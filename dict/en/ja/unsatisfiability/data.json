It refers to a situation where a set of conditions, constraints, or logical statements cannot all be true at the same time. In other words, there is no assignment of values to variables that can make all the statements true simultaneously. It is the opposite of \"satisfiability,\" which means that a solution or model exists that makes the statements true. The concept is crucial in areas like automated reasoning, formal verification, and optimization.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The problem has a high unsatisfiability.","correct":"✓ The problem has a high degree of unsatisfiability.","note":"\"Unsatisfiability\" is a state or property, not a quantity.

It describes a situation where a set of rules or conditions cannot all be true at the same time. Imagine trying to solve a puzzle where the pieces just don't fit together, no matter how you try. That's similar to unsatisfiability. It means there's no solution that can make all the statements or requirements true simultaneously. This concept is important for designing computer programs and solving problems where you have to follow specific rules or constraints.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The **unsatisfiability** of the system requirements led to a complete redesign.","translation":"システム要件の充足不能性が、完全な再設計につながった。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"state of being unsatisfiable"},{"sentence":"The algorithm efficiently detected the **unsatisfiability** of the constraints.","translation":"そのアルゴリズムは制約の充足不能性を効率的に検出した。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"state of being unsatisfiable"},{"sentence":"The proof of **unsatisfiability** required advanced logical reasoning.","translation":"充足不能性の証明には、高度な論理的推論が必要だった。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"state of being unsatisfiable"}]}

It is typically used in formal or technical contexts, such as finance, property assessment, or film criticism. The prefix 'un-' indicates negation, and the base word 'ratable' means capable of being rated. Therefore, 'unratable' signifies the opposite: not capable of being rated due to various reasons, such as lack of data, extreme conditions, or subjective qualities.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The experimental artwork was considered **unratable** by traditional standards.","translation":"その実験的な芸術作品は、従来の基準では評価不能とみなされた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"評価できない"},{"sentence":"Due to the extreme volatility, the cryptocurrency was deemed **unratable** by most financial institutions.","translation":"極端な変動性のため、その暗号通貨はほとんどの金融機関によって評価不能と判断された。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"評価できない"},{"sentence":"The sheer scale of the disaster made a comprehensive assessment virtually **unratable** in the immediate aftermath.","translation":"災害の規模があまりにも大きかったため、災害直後の包括的な評価は事実上不可能だった。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"評価できない"}]}

Because it's formed by adding 'non-' to 'hectically,' understanding 'hectic' is key. 'Hectic' means rushed, chaotic, or very busy. Therefore, 'nonhectically' means the opposite: doing something without the rush or chaos. It's a useful word for describing a deliberate and calm approach, especially when others might be acting frantically."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The team worked nonhectically to meet the deadline, focusing on quality over speed.","translation":"チームは締め切りに間に合わせるために慌ただしくなく仕事をし、スピードよりも品質に焦点を当てた。","type":"general","meaning_category":"calm manner"},{"sentence":"She organized her schedule nonhectically to avoid feeling overwhelmed.","translation":"彼女は圧倒されないように、スケジュールを慌ただしくなく整理した。","type":"general","meaning_category":"organized approach"}]}

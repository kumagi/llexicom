It refers to the place of one's birth or origin, similar to 'birthplace' or 'homeland.' Due to its infrequent use, it is more likely to be encountered in literature or historical contexts rather than in everyday conversation. Modern alternatives like 'birthplace' or 'country of origin' are generally preferred for clarity and common understanding."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"He longed to return to his birthdom and see the familiar landscapes of his youth.","translation":"彼は故郷に戻り、若き日の見慣れた風景を見たいと切望した。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"出生地"},{"sentence":"Despite his success abroad, he never forgot his humble birthdom.","translation":"海外での成功にもかかわらず、彼は自分の卑しい出生を決して忘れなかった。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"出生の身分"}]}

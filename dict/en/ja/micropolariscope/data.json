It combines the magnification capabilities of a microscope with the polarization analysis of a polariscope. This instrument is primarily used in fields like mineralogy and materials science for the identification and characterization of crystalline substances based on how they interact with polarized light. Understanding its function requires knowledge of both microscopy and polarization principles."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The geologist employed a micropolariscope to determine the composition of the rock sample.","translation":"地質学者は、岩石サンプルの組成を特定するために顕微偏光器を使用した。","type":"example","meaning_category":"identification"},{"sentence":"Using the micropolariscope, the researcher observed the interference patterns within the crystal.","translation":"研究者は顕微偏光器を用いて、結晶内部の干渉パターンを観察した。","type":"example","meaning_category":"observation"}]}

It includes both resistance (opposition to current flow that dissipates energy) and reactance (opposition to current flow that stores energy in electric or magnetic fields). Impedance is usually denoted by the symbol Z and is measured in ohms (Ω). Impedance matching is a crucial technique in electronics to maximize power transfer between circuits.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The impedance are high.","correct":"✓ The impedance is high.","note":"'Impedance' is treated as a singular noun, even though it represents a complex quantity.

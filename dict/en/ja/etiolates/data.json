Ultimately, it traces back to the Latin word 'stipula,' meaning 'stalk' or 'straw.' The connection lies in the pale, straw-like appearance of plants that have been deprived of light.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"ˈiːtiəleɪts","syllables":"e-ti-o-lates"},"inflection":{"verb_forms":{"present_simple":["etiolates"],"past_simple":"etiolated","past_participle":"etiolated","present_participle":"etiolating"}},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Etiolate' is primarily used in botanical contexts to describe the process by which plants become pale and elongated due to a lack of light.

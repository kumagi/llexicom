It describes a characteristic of certain biological structures, specifically that they possess a thick hymenium (a tissue layer containing spore-bearing cells). Due to its technical nature, this word is rarely encountered outside of scientific literature and academic contexts. Understanding requires familiarity with biological terminology, particularly related to fungal anatomy."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"Pachyhymenic asci are a key characteristic in the identification of this fungal species.","translation":"厚膜の子嚢は、この菌類を特定する上で重要な特徴です。","type":"general","meaning_category":"厚膜の"}]}

A positive NPV indicates that the investment is expected to generate more value than its cost, making it a potentially worthwhile project. A negative NPV suggests that the investment's costs outweigh its benefits, indicating it may not be a good investment.

It's a way to figure out if an investment will be profitable. Imagine you're thinking about starting a business. You'll spend money now (cash outflows), but you hope to make money later (cash inflows). NPV helps you compare those future earnings to what you spend today. It does this by figuring out the 'present value' of all that future money, which means how much it's worth today. If the NPV is positive, it means the investment is likely a good idea because you'll make more money than you spend. If it's negative, it's probably not a good idea. It's a key tool in finance for making smart investment decisions."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The company uses NPV to evaluate potential investments.","translation":"会社は潜在的な投資を評価するためにNPVを使用します。","type":"general","meaning_category":"Definition"},{"sentence":"A higher discount rate will result in a lower NPV.","translation":"より高い割引率は、より低いNPVをもたらします。","type":"calculation","meaning_category":"Calculation"},{"sentence":"The project was rejected due to its low NPV.","translation":"そのプロジェクトは、低いNPVのために却下されました。","type":"decision making","meaning_category":"Decision Making"}]}

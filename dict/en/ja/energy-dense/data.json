It's also used in physics and engineering to describe materials, especially fuels, that contain a high amount of energy per unit of mass or volume. The term often carries a slightly negative connotation in nutrition, as energy-dense foods can contribute to weight gain if consumed in excess, especially if they are also nutrient-poor.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The food is dense of energy.","correct":"✓ The food is energy-dense.","note":"The correct term is 'energy-dense,' not 'dense of energy.'"},{"incorrect":"✗ Energy density food.","correct":"✓ Energy-dense food.","note":"'Energy-dense' acts as a compound adjective modifying 'food,' so it should be hyphenated."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["energy density (noun)"],"phrases":["nutrient-dense (adjective)"],"related_concepts":["calorie","kilojoule","nutrition","fuel","energy storage"]},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"B2","frequency_google_ngram":"Relatively low frequency, primarily used in specialized contexts like nutrition and engineering.","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"B2","text":"'Energy-dense' is a technical term used to describe something that has a lot of energy packed into a small amount of space or weight. It's often used when talking about food, where it means that a small serving has a lot of calories. It can also be used to describe fuels that have a lot of energy stored in them.

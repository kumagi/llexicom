This occurs because the surface of the material has an electrical charge, which attracts ions of the opposite charge in the liquid. When the electric field is applied, these ions move, dragging the liquid along with them.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[],"priority":"☆☆☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["electroendosmotic"],"related_terms":["electrophoresis","osmosis","zeta potential"]},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low","priority":"☆☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C2","text":"Electroendosmosis is a scientific term used in chemistry, physics, and engineering.

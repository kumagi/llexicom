Each file or directory is represented by an inode. The inode itself *does not* contain the filename or the actual file data; it contains metadata and pointers to the data blocks on the disk where the file's content is stored. When a file is created, an inode is allocated to it. When a file is deleted, its inode is marked as free and can be reused. Running out of inodes can be a problem even if there is free disk space, because you can't create new files or directories without available inodes.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Inodes contain the actual data of the file.","correct":"✓ Inodes contain metadata about the file and pointers to the data blocks.","note":"Inodes do *not* contain the file's data.

"},{"incorrect":"✗ You can increase the number of inodes on a file system after it's created.","correct":"✓ The number of inodes is fixed when the file system is created. You generally can't change it later without reformatting.","note":"The number of inodes is typically determined when the file system is formatted. Changing it later usually requires reformatting, which will erase all data."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["file system","metadata","data block","directory","ext4","XFS","UFS"],"phrasal_verbs":[],"priority":"★★★"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2 (専門的なIT分野)","frequency_google_ngram":"低頻度 (Low frequency) - 一般的な会話ではほとんど使用されない。","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"An **inode** is a data structure used in file systems to store information *about* a file, not the file's actual contents. Think of it as a library card catalog entry: it tells you where to find the book (the data) but isn't the book itself. Each file or directory has one inode. The inode stores things like the file's size, permissions (who can read, write, execute it), ownership, and timestamps (when it was last modified). A file system has a limited number of inodes. If you run out of inodes, you can't create new files, even if you have free space on your hard drive. This is a technical term primarily used in system administration and software development contexts.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The `stat` command displays the inode number of a file.","translation":"`stat`コマンドは、ファイルのinode番号を表示する。","type":"general","meaning_category":"inode number"},{"sentence":"The file system was running out of inodes, preventing new files from being created.","translation":"ファイルシステムのinodeが不足しており、新しいファイルを作成できなくなっていた。","type":"problem solving","meaning_category":"inode exhaustion"},{"sentence":"The inode contains the file's permissions and ownership information.","translation":"inodeには、ファイルのアクセス権と所有者情報が含まれている。","type":"technical","meaning_category":"metadata storage"}]}

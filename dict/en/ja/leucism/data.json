The key difference is that leucism is a reduction in multiple types of pigment, while albinism is specifically a lack of melanin. Also, leucistic animals typically have normal eye color, whereas albinos have pink or red eyes due to the visibility of blood vessels. Leucism can be partial, resulting in patches of white, or complete, resulting in an entirely white animal.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The white peacock is an albino.","correct":"✓ The white peacock is leucistic.","note":"White peacocks are typically leucistic, not albino, as they often retain some pigmentation in their eyes and other tissues."},{"incorrect":"✗ Leucism only affects mammals.","correct":"✓ Leucism can affect birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fish, as well as mammals.","note":"Leucism is found across a wide range of animal species."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["leucistic (adjective: 白変種の)"],"phrasal_verbs":[],"related_terms":["albinism","melanin","pigmentation","hypopigmentation","hyperpigmentation"],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency.

This results in a white or pale appearance of the animal's skin, feathers, or fur.

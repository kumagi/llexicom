It refers to a student who is ill and therefore excused from attending classes or exams. It can also be used as an adjective to describe circumstances related to illness, such as an 'aegrotant degree'. Due to its limited usage and formal nature, it is typically encountered in academic or administrative settings within the UK. Understanding its meaning requires a high level of English proficiency and familiarity with British educational terminology."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The university has a policy for dealing with aegrotant students during exam season.","translation":"大学には試験期間中の病欠学生への対応に関する規定があります。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"病欠学生"},{"sentence":"Due to her prolonged illness, she was awarded an aegrotant pass in the course.","translation":"彼女は長期の病気のため、そのコースで病欠合格を授与されました。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"病欠の"}]}

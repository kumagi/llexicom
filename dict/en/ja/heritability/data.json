It ranges from 0 to 1 (or 0% to 100%). A high heritability indicates that a large proportion of the variation in a trait is due to genetic factors, while a low heritability suggests that environmental factors play a more significant role. It's important to note that heritability is specific to a particular population and environment, and it does not indicate the degree to which a trait is genetically determined in an individual.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Heritability means that the trait is completely genetic.","correct":"✓ Heritability indicates the proportion of variation due to genetic factors, not complete genetic determination.","note":"Heritability is a population statistic, not an individual one.

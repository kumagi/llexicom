This is often a desirable characteristic, as it simplifies the processing pipeline and avoids the need for separate handling of compressed and uncompressed data. It is commonly encountered in the context of image and video processing, data storage, and data transmission.","priority":"N/A"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The system is compression independent.","correct":"✓ The system is compression-independent.","note":"The hyphen is important to correctly convey the meaning of a single compound adjective."}],"priority":"N/A"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["compression","independent","dependence"],"phrasal_verbs":[]},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2 (Technical vocabulary)","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency","priority":"N/A"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"The term 'compression-independent' describes a system or method that works the same way whether the data it processes is compressed or not.

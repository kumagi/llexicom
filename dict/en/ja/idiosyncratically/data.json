'Idiosyncrasy' originates from the Greek 'idiosynkrasia,' meaning 'a peculiar temperament' or 'a mixture peculiar to one individual.' It combines 'idios' (one's own, private) and 'synkrasis' (mixture, temperament). The adverbial form '-ally' is added to 'idiosyncratic' to describe the manner in which something is done.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/ˌɪdiəsɪŋˈkrætɪkli/","syllables":"id-i-o-syn-crat-i-cal-ly"},"inflection":{"notes":"Adverbs do not typically inflect.","adverb_forms":{}},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Idiosyncratically' describes actions or behaviors that are highly specific to an individual, reflecting their unique personality, preferences, or habits.

It is formed by adding the suffix '-less' to the noun 'stopper', indicating the absence of a stopper. It is primarily used in descriptive contexts to specify that an object, typically a container like a bottle, does not have a stopper. Due to its specific and somewhat technical nature, it is not frequently encountered in everyday language. Understanding the meaning of the root word 'stopper' and the suffix '-less' is helpful in deciphering its meaning."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The antique perfume bottle was beautiful, but unfortunately, it was stopperless.","translation":"そのアンティークの香水瓶は美しかったが、残念ながら栓がなかった。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"栓のない"},{"sentence":"The chemist carefully handled the stopperless test tube to avoid spilling the contents.","translation":"化学者は中身をこぼさないように、栓のない試験管を注意深く扱った。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"栓のない"}]}

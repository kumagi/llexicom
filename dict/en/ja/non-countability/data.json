These are often substances (like water or sand), abstract concepts (like information or advice), or collective entities (like furniture or luggage). Because they are not countable, they don't typically have plural forms and require specific quantifiers. Understanding non-countability is important for using correct grammar, especially when forming sentences with these types of nouns."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The non-countability of 'furniture' means we say 'a piece of furniture' instead of 'a furniture'.","translation":"'furniture'が不可算名詞であるため、「a furniture」ではなく「a piece of furniture」と言います。","type":"example","meaning_category":"definition"},{"sentence":"The professor discussed the implications of non-countability in various languages.","translation":"教授は、さまざまな言語における不可算性の意味合いについて議論しました。","type":"example","meaning_category":"usage"},{"sentence":"Students often struggle with the concept of non-countability when learning English.","translation":"学生は英語を学ぶ際に、不可算性の概念に苦労することがよくあります。","type":"example","meaning_category":"learning"}]}

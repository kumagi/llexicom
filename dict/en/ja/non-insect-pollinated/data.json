Instead, these plants typically use wind or water to transfer pollen. Understanding this term requires knowledge of basic botanical concepts such as pollination and the different methods plants use to reproduce. The prefix 'non-' simply indicates negation, meaning 'not'. Therefore, 'non-insect-pollinated' means 'not pollinated by insects'."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"Ragweed is a common non-insect-pollinated plant that releases large amounts of pollen into the air.","translation":"ブタクサは一般的な非昆虫媒植物で、大量の花粉を空気中に放出します。","type":"general","meaning_category":"description"},{"sentence":"The study focused on the adaptations of non-insect-pollinated species to wind pollination.","translation":"その研究は、非昆虫媒種が風媒に適応するための適応に焦点を当てました。","type":"research","meaning_category":"research"}]}

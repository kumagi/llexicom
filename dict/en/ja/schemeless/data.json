It is not a very common word, and it is usually used in formal or academic writing. It is formed by adding the suffix \"-less\" to the word \"scheme,\" which means \"plan\" or \"system.\" Therefore, \"schemeless\" means \"without a plan or system.\" It is often used to describe someone's approach to something, such as a project or a task. For example, you might say that someone has a \"schemeless approach\" to investing if they do not have a clear plan for how they will invest their money."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The artist's schemeless approach to painting allowed for unexpected creativity.","translation":"その芸術家の計画性のない絵画への取り組みは、予期せぬ創造性を可能にした。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"無計画な"},{"sentence":"A schemeless vacation can be relaxing, but it can also be stressful if things go wrong.","translation":"計画性のない休暇はリラックスできるかもしれないが、うまくいかない場合はストレスになる可能性もある。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"無計画な"}]}

The movement or displacement of statoliths in response to gravity triggers a signal transduction pathway that allows the organism to orient itself correctly.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The statolith is responsible for hearing in humans.","correct":"✓ The statolith is responsible for balance in some invertebrates.","note":"Statoliths are primarily involved in balance, not hearing.

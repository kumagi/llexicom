It implies a harsh, scornful, and often devastating critique or look. The effect is similar to that of a plant withering and dying. It is often used to describe withering looks, comments, or criticisms.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ She smiled witheringly at him.","correct":"✓ She smiled sarcastically at him.","note":"A smile is generally positive.

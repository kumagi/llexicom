They allow for better control of environmental factors such as temperature, pH, light intensity, and CO2 concentration. This control leads to higher biomass productivity and reduced contamination risk. Photobioreactors are used for various applications, including biofuel production, wastewater treatment, production of high-value chemicals (e.g., pigments, pharmaceuticals), and CO2 sequestration. Different designs exist, such as tubular, flat-panel, and stirred-tank photobioreactors, each with its own advantages and disadvantages.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ photo bioreactor","correct":"✓ photobioreactor","note":"It is one word, not two separate words."},{"incorrect":"✗ The photobioreactor is use to grow bacteria.","correct":"✓ The photobioreactor is used to grow algae.","note":"Photobioreactors are specifically designed for photosynthetic microorganisms like algae and cyanobacteria, not bacteria in general (although some bacteria are photosynthetic)."},{"incorrect":"✗ open pond","correct":"✓ photobioreactor","note":"Photobioreactors are closed systems, unlike open ponds."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["photobioreaction","bioreactor","photosynthesis","algae","microalgae","cyanobacteria","biomass","biofuel","biotechnology"],"phrasal_verbs":[],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C1","frequency_google_ngram":"Relatively low frequency, primarily used in scientific and technical contexts.","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"The term \"photobioreactor\" is technical and primarily used in scientific, engineering, and biotechnology contexts.

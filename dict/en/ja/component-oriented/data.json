Instead of creating one big program, developers break it down into smaller, independent parts called 'components.' Each component does a specific job and can be reused in different parts of the program or even in other programs. This makes the software easier to understand, update, and maintain. Think of it like building with LEGO bricks – each brick is a component that can be combined with others to create something bigger.","priority":"★★★"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The new system is designed with a component-oriented approach to improve maintainability.","translation":"新しいシステムは、保守性を向上させるためにコンポーネント指向のアプローチで設計されている。","type":"general","meaning_category":"General usage"},{"sentence":"A component-oriented architecture allows for easier integration of third-party libraries.","translation":"コンポーネント指向アーキテクチャにより、サードパーティライブラリの統合が容易になる。","type":"technical","meaning_category":"Technical context"},{"sentence":"We adopted a component-oriented methodology to accelerate the development process.","translation":"開発プロセスを加速するために、コンポーネント指向の方法論を採用した。","type":"methodology","meaning_category":"Methodology"}]}

It involves measuring the positions, distances, and motions of celestial objects with high precision. These measurements are used to create star catalogs, determine the distances to stars and galaxies, and study the dynamics of the solar system and the Milky Way galaxy. Modern astrometry relies on both ground-based and space-based telescopes, and it plays a crucial role in the search for exoplanets.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Astrometry study the chemical composition of stars.","correct":"✓ Astrometry measures the positions and motions of stars.","note":"Astrometry focuses on the positions and motions of celestial objects, not their chemical composition (which is the domain of spectroscopy)."},{"incorrect":"✗ Astrometry is not important for modern astronomy.","correct":"✓ Astrometry is crucial for modern astronomy.","note":"Astrometry is a fundamental branch of astronomy that provides the basic framework for many other astronomical studies."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["astrometric (adjective)","astrometrist (noun)"],"phrasal_verbs":[],"priority":"★★★"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"Astrometry is a specialized term in astronomy referring to the precise measurement of the positions and movements of celestial objects like stars and planets.

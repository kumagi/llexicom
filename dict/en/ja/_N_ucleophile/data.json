Nucleophiles are typically electron-rich, possessing lone pairs or pi bonds, and are attracted to positive charges or partially positive centers in molecules. The strength of a nucleophile is influenced by factors such as charge, electronegativity, steric hindrance, and the solvent. Nucleophiles are crucial in various organic reactions, including substitution and addition reactions.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Nucleophiles are positive charged.","correct":"✓ Nucleophiles are negatively charged or neutral with lone pairs.","note":"Nucleophiles are electron-rich, so they are either negatively charged or neutral with lone pairs of electrons available for bonding."},{"incorrect":"✗ Electrophiles are attracted to nucleophiles because they both have negative charges.","correct":"✓ Electrophiles are attracted to nucleophiles because electrophiles are electron-deficient and nucleophiles are electron-rich.","note":"Electrophiles are electron-deficient and are attracted to the electron-rich nucleophiles."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["nucleophilic (adjective: 求核的な)","nucleophilicity (noun: 求核性)"],"related_terms":["electrophile (求電子剤)","leaving group (脱離基)","SN1 reaction (SN1反応)","SN2 reaction (SN2反応)","addition reaction (付加反応)","substitution reaction (置換反応)"],"priority":"★★★"},"level_frequency":{"frequency_google_ngram":"Relatively low frequency, primarily used in chemistry contexts.","priority":"★★☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"A **nucleophile** is a term used in chemistry to describe a molecule or ion that is attracted to positive charges or partially positive areas in other molecules. It donates a pair of electrons to form a new chemical bond. Think of it as something that 'loves' the nucleus (the positively charged center) of an atom. Nucleophiles are important in many chemical reactions, especially in organic chemistry. They are often negatively charged or have lone pairs of electrons that they can share. Understanding nucleophiles is key to understanding how many chemical reactions occur.","note":"This explanation assumes a basic understanding of chemistry concepts such as atoms, molecules, charges, and chemical bonds."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The reaction proceeds via a **nucleophile** attacking an electrophilic center.","translation":"その反応は、求核剤が求電子的な中心を攻撃することによって進行します。","type":"general"},{"sentence":"Cyanide ions are strong **nucleophiles** and can be used in various organic syntheses.","translation":"シアン化物イオンは強力な求核剤であり、様々な有機合成で使用できます。","type":"specific"},{"sentence":"The **nucleophilicity** of an atom depends on its electron density and steric environment.","translation":"原子の求核性は、その電子密度と立体的な環境に依存します。","type":"related"},{"sentence":"In SN2 reactions, the **nucleophile** attacks the substrate in a single step.","translation":"SN2反応では、求核剤は一段階で基質を攻撃します。","type":"reaction_type"}]}

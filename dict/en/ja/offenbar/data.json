As an adverb, it modifies a verb or sentence, indicating the apparent nature of the action or situation. As an adjective, it describes a noun, emphasizing its obvious or evident quality.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"Er ist offenbar zu Hause, aber ich bin nicht sicher.","correct":"Er ist offenbar zu Hause.","note":"The phrase 'aber ich bin nicht sicher' (but I am not sure) contradicts the meaning of 'offenbar', which implies a degree of certainty based on available evidence.

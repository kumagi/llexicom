This is in contrast to autotrophs, which produce their own food through photosynthesis, and parasites, which obtain nutrients from living organisms. Saprophytes are essential for decomposition and nutrient cycling in ecosystems. While the term is most often applied to fungi and bacteria, some plants are also saprophytic. The term 'saprotroph' is sometimes used interchangeably, but 'saprophyte' is often reserved for plants.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The saprophyte was green and leafy.","correct":"✓ The saprophyte was white or brown, lacking chlorophyll.","note":"Saprophytes typically lack chlorophyll and are not green, as they do not photosynthesize."},{"incorrect":"✗ Saprophytes harm living plants.","correct":"✓ Saprophytes feed on dead organic matter.","note":"Saprophytes do not harm living plants; they feed on dead material."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["saprophytic (adjective: 腐生性の)","saprophyte (noun: 腐生植物)","saprotroph (noun: 腐生生物 - より広義)","saprotrophic (adjective: 腐生性の - より広義)"],"phrasal_verbs":[],"priority":"★★★"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"The term 'saprophyte' refers to an organism, usually a fungus or bacterium, that gets its food from dead and decaying organic matter.

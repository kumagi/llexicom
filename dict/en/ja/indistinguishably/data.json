To use \"indistinguishably\", you need to use it as an adverb modifying a verb or adjective (e.g., \"indistinguishably similar\")."},{"incorrect":"✗ They acted indistinguishably.","correct":"✓ They acted almost indistinguishably. / ✓ Their actions were indistinguishable.","note":"While grammatically correct, \"They acted indistinguishably\" is less common and can sound awkward.

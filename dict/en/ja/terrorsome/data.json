It's similar to 'terrifying' but is used less frequently in modern English. You might encounter it in older literature or in more descriptive writing where the author wants to emphasize the intensity of the fear being evoked. Because it's not a common word, using 'terrifying' or 'horrifying' is often a clearer and more direct way to convey the same meaning.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The haunted house was filled with terrorsome creatures and eerie sounds.","translation":"そのお化け屋敷は、恐ろしい生き物と不気味な音で満たされていた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"恐ろしい"},{"sentence":"The storm brought a terrorsome darkness that enveloped the entire town.","translation":"嵐は、町全体を包み込む恐ろしい暗闇をもたらした。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"恐ろしい"},{"sentence":"The terrorsome tale kept the children awake all night.","translation":"その恐ろしい物語は、子供たちを一晩中眠らせなかった。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"恐ろしい"}]}

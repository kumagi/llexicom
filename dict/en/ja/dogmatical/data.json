It often carries a negative connotation, suggesting arrogance or a lack of intellectual humility. While 'dogmatic' and 'dogmatical' are often used interchangeably, 'dogmatical' can sometimes emphasize the *manner* in which opinions are expressed, rather than just holding firm beliefs.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ He was very dogmatical about his feelings.","correct":"✓ He was very dogmatic about his beliefs.","note":"'Dogmatical' and 'dogmatic' are used to describe strongly held beliefs or opinions, not feelings.

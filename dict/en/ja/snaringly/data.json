It is derived from the word 'snare,' which is a type of trap. Therefore, 'snaringly' implies a cunning or manipulative quality in the action being described. Because of its specific and somewhat negative connotation, it is not frequently used in everyday language, making it more appropriate for advanced learners and contexts where precise and nuanced language is required."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The company's marketing campaign was snaringly effective, drawing in customers with promises that seemed too good to be true.","translation":"その会社のマーケティングキャンペーンは罠を仕掛けるように効果的で、顧客を信じられないほど良い約束で引き込んだ。","type":"general","meaning_category":"enticingly"},{"sentence":"The spy snaringly extracted information from his target by feigning friendship.","translation":"そのスパイは友情を装って、標的から罠を仕掛けるように情報を引き出した。","type":"general","meaning_category":"deceptively"}]}

It is not a common term and is more likely to be found in literature or creative writing than in everyday conversation. Understanding the word requires knowledge of the suffix \"-dom,\" which denotes a state, realm, or dominion. The word can be used literally to refer to the environment in which pigs live, or metaphorically to describe a situation or group of people characterized by pig-like qualities. Due to its rarity and nuanced usage, it is best suited for advanced learners.","priority":"★☆☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The little piglets explored their pigdom with boundless curiosity.","translation":"小さな子豚たちは無限の好奇心を持って自分たちの豚の世界を探検した。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"豚の世界"},{"sentence":"In his dream, he ruled over a vast and prosperous pigdom.","translation":"彼の夢の中で、彼は広大で繁栄した豚の王国を支配していた。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"豚の王国"},{"sentence":"The farmer created a comfortable pigdom for his livestock.","translation":"農夫は家畜のために快適な豚の世界を作り出した。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"豚の世界"}]}

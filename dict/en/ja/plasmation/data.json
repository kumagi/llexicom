Plasma is often referred to as the fourth state of matter, distinct from solid, liquid, and gas, characterized by the presence of free ions and electrons. The term is primarily encountered in academic research, industrial processes involving plasma treatment, and related scientific contexts. It's important to differentiate 'plasmation' (the process) from 'plasma' (the substance)."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The efficiency of the plasmation is crucial for the overall performance of the plasma reactor.","translation":"プラズマ化の効率は、プラズマ反応器全体の性能にとって非常に重要である。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"process"},{"sentence":"The researchers investigated different methods of plasmation to improve the yield of the reaction.","translation":"研究者たちは、反応の収率を向上させるために、さまざまなプラズマ化の方法を調査した。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"process"},{"sentence":"The plasmation process requires precise control of temperature and pressure.","translation":"プラズマ化プロセスでは、温度と圧力を正確に制御する必要がある。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"process"}]}

These dyes are typically used in the textile industry to produce deep and intense colors, particularly in shades of black, brown, and dark blue. The presence of multiple azo groups contributes to the dye's ability to absorb light across a wider range of wavelengths, resulting in the desired color depth. However, some azo dyes, including certain tetrakisazo dyes, have raised concerns regarding their potential toxicity and environmental impact, leading to regulations and restrictions on their use in some regions.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Tetrakisazo is a type of polymer.","correct":"✓ Tetrakisazo is a type of dye.","note":"Tetrakisazo is a dye, not a polymer.

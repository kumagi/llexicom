The term was initially used to describe devices that 'served' to control other mechanisms. The combination of 'servo' and 'motor' indicates a motor that acts as a 'slave' to a control system, precisely following commands.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/ˌsɜːrvoʊˈmoʊtərz/","syllables":"ser-vo-mo-tors"},"inflection":{"noun_plural":"servomotors"},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Servomotors' are typically used in closed-loop control systems where feedback is used to correct the motor's position or speed.

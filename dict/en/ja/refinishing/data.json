Therefore, 'refinish' literally means 'to finish again' or 'to complete anew.'","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/ˌriːˈfɪnɪʃɪŋ/","syllables":"re-fin-ish-ing"},"inflection":{"noun_plural":"refinishings (rarely used in plural form)","verb_forms":{"base_form":"refinish","present_simple":["refinish","refinishes"],"past_simple":"refinished","past_participle":"refinished","present_participle":"refinishing"}},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Refinishing' is commonly used in the context of home improvement and furniture restoration.

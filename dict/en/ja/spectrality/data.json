The first, more literal sense, refers to the qualities associated with spectra or ghosts. The second, more abstract sense, particularly in philosophical and sociological contexts, refers to the state of being like a ghost, a presence that is also an absence. This concept is often associated with the work of Jacques Derrida, who used it to explore the relationship between past and present, presence and absence.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The spectrality was very quiet.","correct":"✓ The spectrality was very eerie.","note":"'Spectrality' refers to a quality or state, not a being.

It is most often encountered in academic writing, particularly in philosophy, literary theory, and sociology. It refers to the quality of being spectral, which can mean resembling a ghost or phantom, or, more abstractly, the state of being both present and absent.

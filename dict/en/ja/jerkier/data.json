'Jerky' comes from 'jerk', which originally meant a sudden, sharp pull or twist. The suffix '-y' was added to indicate a quality or characteristic of something having those sudden, sharp movements.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/ˈdʒɜːrkiər/","syllables":"jer-ki-er"},"inflection":{"adjective_forms":{"comparative":"jerkier","superlative":"jerkiest"}},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Jerkier' is used to compare two things, indicating that one has more of the quality of being 'jerky' than the other. 'Jerky' describes movements or actions that are sudden, sharp, and not smooth. It can also describe something that is uneven or erratic. 'Jerkier' is used when you want to emphasize that the difference in the quality of being jerky is significant.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The car was jerkier than smooth.","correct":"✓ The car was jerkier than usual.","note":"When using the comparative form 'jerkier', you should compare two distinct subjects or situations, not a subject with a quality. Comparing 'the car' with 'smooth' is incorrect. Instead, compare the car's current state with its usual state or with another car."},{"incorrect":"✗ This video is very jerkier.","correct":"✓ This video is very jerky.","note":"'Jerkier' is already a comparative form. You don't need to use 'very' with it. If you want to emphasize the degree of jerkiness without comparison, use 'very jerky' instead."},{"incorrect":"✗ He became jerkier and jerkier.","correct":"✓ His movements became more and more jerky.","note":"While 'more and more' is commonly used to show increasing intensity, 'jerkier and jerkier' sounds awkward. It's better to use 'more and more jerky' or 'increasingly jerky' to describe a gradual increase in jerkiness."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["jerk (noun, verb)","jerky (adjective)","jerkily (adverb)","jerkiness (noun)"],"antonyms":["smoother","steadier","more fluid","more even","more coordinated"],"synonyms":["more abrupt","more spasmodic","more uneven","more erratic","more shaky"]},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"B2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"B2","text":"'Jerkier' is a comparative adjective used to describe something that has more sudden, sharp, or uneven movements compared to something else.

Azeotropes are mixtures of two or more liquids whose proportions cannot be altered or changed by simple distillation. This is because when an azeotrope is boiled, the vapor has the same proportions of constituents as the unboiled mixture.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The azeotropism was separated by distillation.","correct":"✓ The azeotrope was separated by special techniques.","note":"Azeotropes cannot be separated by standard distillation due to azeotropism.

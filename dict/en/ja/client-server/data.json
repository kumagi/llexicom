It describes how applications are structured so that tasks are divided between service requesters (clients) and service providers (servers). Clients typically initiate communication by sending requests, and servers listen for these requests and respond accordingly. This architecture allows for efficient resource sharing, centralized management, and scalability.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ client server","correct":"✓ client-server","note":"The term is typically hyphenated as 'client-server' when used as a compound noun or adjective."},{"incorrect":"✗ The client-server is a computer.","correct":"✓ The client-server is a system.","note":"'Client-server' refers to a system or architecture, not a single piece of hardware."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":[],"phrasal_verbs":[],"related_concepts":["Three-tier architecture","N-tier architecture","RESTful API","Microservices"],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"B2","frequency_google_ngram":"Relatively common in technical contexts.","priority":"★★☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"B2","text":"'Client-server' refers to a way of organizing computer programs where one program (the client) asks for something from another program (the server).

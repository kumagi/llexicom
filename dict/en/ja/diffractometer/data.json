The resulting diffraction pattern provides information about the structure of the material, including the arrangement of atoms, molecules, or crystal lattices. Different types of diffractometers are designed for specific types of samples (e.g., single crystals, powders) and radiation sources.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The diffractometer measure the structure.","correct":"✓ The diffractometer measures the structure.","note":"Diffractometerは単数名詞なので、動詞は三人称単数形にします。"},{"incorrect":"✗ Diffractometer are used to determine structure.","correct":"✓ Diffractometers are used to determine structure.","note":"Diffractometersは複数名詞なので、動詞は複数形にします。"}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["diffraction (名詞: 回折)","diffract (動詞: 回折させる)","diffractive (形容詞: 回折性の)"],"related_fields":["crystallography (結晶学)","materials science (材料科学)","solid-state physics (固体物理学)"],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"比較的低頻度 (Relatively low frequency) - 専門用語。","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"A diffractometer is a complex scientific instrument used to analyze the structure of materials. It works by measuring how X-rays, neutrons, or electrons are diffracted (scattered) when they hit a sample.

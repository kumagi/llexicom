This is particularly important when dealing with rapidly evolving targets, such as viruses or cancer cells, where mutations can quickly render treatments ineffective.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ mutation independent","correct":"✓ mutation-independent","note":"The term is typically hyphenated to clearly indicate the relationship between 'mutation' and 'independent'."}],"priority":"N/A"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["mutation","independent","dependence"],"related_terms":["mutation-dependent","mutation-driven","mutation analysis","drug resistance","targeted therapy"]},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2 (Specialized vocabulary)","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency (specialized scientific vocabulary)","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Mutation-independent' is a technical term used in fields like genetics and medicine.

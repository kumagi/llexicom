It is less abundant than nicotine but is still considered an important component of tobacco. Nornicotine is formed by the demethylation of nicotine, a process that can occur during tobacco curing, aging, and smoking. It is also found in some other plants, such as certain species of Solanaceae. Nornicotine has been shown to have pharmacological effects similar to nicotine, including addictive properties. It is also a precursor to other tobacco-specific nitrosamines (TSNAs), which are potent carcinogens.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Nornicotine is safe to consume.","correct":"✓ Nornicotine is not safe to consume.","note":"Nornicotine, like nicotine, is addictive and has potential health risks."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["nicotine","alkaloid","tobacco","TSNA (tobacco-specific nitrosamine)"],"priority":"★★★"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"Nornicotine is a technical term related to chemistry and tobacco research.

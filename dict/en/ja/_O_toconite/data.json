They play a crucial role in sensing linear acceleration and gravity, which is essential for maintaining balance and spatial orientation. When the head moves, the otoconites shift, stimulating hair cells that send signals to the brain, allowing it to perceive movement and orientation.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Otoconite is made of bone.","correct":"✓ Otoconite is made of calcium carbonate.","note":"Otoconites are made of calcium carbonate, not bone."},{"incorrect":"✗ Otoconites are in the outer ear.","correct":"✓ Otoconites are in the inner ear.","note":"Otoconites are located in the inner ear, specifically in the utricle and saccule."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["otoconia","otolith"],"phrasal_verbs":[],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Otoconite' is a technical term related to anatomy and physiology, specifically referring to the small calcium carbonate crystals in the inner ear that are essential for balance.

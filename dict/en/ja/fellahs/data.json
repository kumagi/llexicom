'Fellow' comes from Old English 'fēolaga', meaning 'partner, one who shares with another'. It is a compound of 'fēo' (fee, property) and '-laga' (one who lays down, i.e., contributes). Over time, it evolved to mean 'companion' or 'associate'. The plural 'fellows' became 'fellahs' through informal pronunciation and spelling variations.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/ˈfɛləz/","syllables":"fel-lahs"},"inflection":{"noun_plural":"fellahs (non-standard plural of fellow)"},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Fellahs' is a colloquial and often dialectal variant of 'fellows'. It is primarily used in informal speech and writing to refer to a group of men or boys. The term carries a slightly old-fashioned or folksy connotation.

Glycans are often attached to proteins (glycoproteins) or lipids (glycolipids) and are involved in various biological functions, including cell-cell recognition, immune response, and protein folding. The study of glycans is complex due to their structural diversity and the lack of a direct template for their synthesis, unlike proteins and nucleic acids.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Glycans are made of amino acids.","correct":"✓ Glycans are made of monosaccharides.","note":"Glycans are carbohydrates, so they are composed of monosaccharides (simple sugars), not amino acids (which make up proteins)."},{"incorrect":"✗ Glycans have a direct template for synthesis like DNA.","correct":"✓ Glycans do not have a direct template for synthesis like DNA.","note":"Unlike DNA and proteins, glycans are not synthesized from a direct template.

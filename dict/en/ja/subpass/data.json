Render passes are a sequence of operations that produce a final image. Subpasses allow you to perform multiple rendering operations while keeping the data in the GPU's memory, which can improve performance.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The subpass was subpasted.","correct":"✓ The subpass was executed.","note":"'Subpasted' is not a standard term in graphics programming.

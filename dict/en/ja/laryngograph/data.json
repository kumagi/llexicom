It works by passing a high-frequency, low-voltage current across the larynx and measuring the impedance. The resulting signal, called an Lx waveform, provides information about the timing and completeness of vocal fold closure.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ laryngraph","correct":"✓ laryngograph","note":"The correct spelling includes the 'o' after 'laryng-'."},{"incorrect":"✗ Using laryngograph is useful.","correct":"✓ Using a laryngograph is useful.","note":"'Laryngograph' is a countable noun, so it usually requires an article ('a', 'an', 'the') or a possessive pronoun."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["laryngography (noun: the process of using a laryngograph)","electroglottography (EGG) (noun: a similar technique)"],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency - specialist term.","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"The term 'laryngograph' refers to a specialized instrument used in phonetics and speech pathology.

It refers to an air-fuel mixture that contains a higher proportion of air than is optimal for complete combustion. While a fuel-lean mixture can improve fuel economy and reduce certain emissions, it can also lead to higher combustion temperatures and potential engine damage if not properly managed. Understanding this term requires some familiarity with engine operation and combustion principles."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"A **fuel-lean** mixture can cause the engine to knock.","translation":"燃料が薄い混合気は、エンジンノックを引き起こす可能性がある。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"燃料が薄い"},{"sentence":"The mechanic adjusted the carburetor to prevent the engine from running **fuel-lean**.","translation":"整備士は、エンジンが燃料が薄い状態で運転されるのを防ぐために、キャブレターを調整した。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"燃料が薄い"},{"sentence":"Prolonged operation in a **fuel-lean** condition can damage the catalytic converter.","translation":"燃料が薄い状態での長時間の運転は、触媒コンバーターを損傷する可能性がある。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"燃料が薄い"}]}

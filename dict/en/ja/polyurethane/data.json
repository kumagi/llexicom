A wide range of polyurethanes are used, with varying hardnesses, densities, and other properties. These polymers are used in flexible and rigid foams, durable elastomers and coatings, and high-performance adhesives and sealants. Polyurethane is formed by reacting a polyol (an alcohol with more than two reactive hydroxyl groups per molecule) with a diisocyanate or a polymeric isocyanate in the presence of suitable catalysts and additives. Because a wide variety of diisocyanates and polyols can be used, a wide range of materials can be produced to meet the needs of specific applications.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The insulation in the walls is made of **polyurethane** foam.","translation":"壁の断熱材はポリウレタンフォームでできています。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"material"},{"sentence":"The **polyurethane** coating protects the wood from moisture.","translation":"ポリウレタンコーティングは木材を湿気から保護します。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"made of polyurethane"}]}

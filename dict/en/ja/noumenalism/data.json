It is closely associated with Immanuel Kant's philosophy, particularly his distinction between phenomena (things as they appear to us) and noumena (things as they are in themselves). Noumenalism suggests that our knowledge is limited to the phenomenal realm, and we can never access or comprehend the true nature of reality beyond our sensory experience and cognitive structures.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[],"priority":"★☆☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["noumenon","noumenal","phenomenalism","phenomenon"],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Very low frequency","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C2","text":"Noumenalism is a complex philosophical term referring to the belief that the true nature of reality (noumena) is unknowable.

More combined the Greek words 'ou' (not) and 'topos' (place) to create 'utopia,' meaning 'no place.' However, 'utopia' also sounds like 'eutopia,' from the Greek 'eu' (good or well) and 'topos' (place), meaning 'good place.' This ambiguity suggests that More intended utopia to be understood as both a non-existent place and an ideal place. 'Utopians' are thus those who believe in or strive for such an ideal, though often with the implication of impracticality.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/juːˈtoʊpiənz/","syllables":"u-to-pi-ans"},"inflection":{"noun_plural":"utopians","adjective_forms":{"comparative":"","superlative":""}},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"The term 'utopians' can be used in both a positive and a negative sense.

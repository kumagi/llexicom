It describes a situation where an individual feels justified or proven right, often without external validation. The word combines the concept of \"vindication\" (being cleared of blame or suspicion) with the idea of doing it oneself. Understanding requires grasping the subtle difference between being genuinely proven right and simply believing oneself to be so. This word is more common in formal writing or discussions involving ethics, justification, or personal beliefs."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"Despite the criticism, the artist felt self-vindicated by the positive response to his exhibition.","translation":"批判にもかかわらず、そのアーティストは展覧会への肯定的な反応によって自己正当化されたと感じた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"feeling justified"},{"sentence":"The scientist presented her data as self-vindicated, confident that the results spoke for themselves.","translation":"その科学者は、結果がそれ自体を物語っていると確信し、自身のデータを自己弁護されたものとして提示した。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"presenting as justified"},{"sentence":"He walked away from the argument feeling self-vindicated, even though no one else agreed with him.","translation":"彼は誰一人として同意しなかったにもかかわらず、自己正当化されたと感じながら議論から立ち去った。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"feeling justified despite disagreement"}]}

Fare thee well at once! / The glow-worm shows the matin to be near, / And 'gins to pale his uneffectual fire: / Adieu, adieu! Hamlet, remember me. [Exit Ghost] / O all you host of heaven! O earth! what else? / And shall I couple hell? O, fie! Hold, hold, my heart; / And you, my sinews, grow not instant old, / But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee! / Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat / In this distracted globe. Remember thee! / Yea, from the table of my memory / I'll wipe away all trivial fond records, / All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past, / That youth and observation copied there; / And thy commandment all alone shall live / Within the book and volume of my brain, / Unmix'd with baser matter: yes, by heaven! / O most pernicious woman! / O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain! / My tables,—meet it is I set it down, / That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain; / At least I'm sure it may be so in Denmark: [Writing] / So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word; / It is 'Adieu, adieu! remember me.' / I have sworn't. / Hor. [Within] My lord, my lord! / Mar. [Within] Lord Hamlet! / Hor. [Within] Heaven secure him! / Mar. [Within] So be it! / Hor. [Within] Hillo, ho, ho, my lord! / Ham. Hillo, ho, ho, boy! come, bird, come. / Enter Horatio and Marcellus. / Mar. How is't, my noble lord? / Hor. What news, my lord? / Ham. O, wonderful! / Hor. Good my lord, tell it. / Ham. No; you will reveal it. / Hor. Not I, my lord, by heaven. / Mar. Nor I, my lord. / Ham. How say you, then; would heart of man once think it? / But you'll be secret? / Both. Ay, by heaven, my lord. / Ham. There's ne'er a villain dwelling in all Denmark / But he's an arrant knave. / Hor. There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave / To tell us this. / Ham. Why, right; you are in the right; / And so, without more circumstance at all, / I hold it fit that we shake hands and part: / You, as your business and desire shall point you; / For every man has business and desire, / Such as it is; and for mine own poor part, / Look you, I'll go pray. / Hor. These are but wild and whirling words, my lord. / Ham. I am sorry they offend you, heartily; / Yes, faith, heartily. / Hor. There's no offence, my lord. / Ham. Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio, / And much offence too. Touching this vision here,— / It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you: / For your desire to know what is between us, / O'ermaster 't as you may. And now, good friends, / As you are friends, scholars, and soldiers, / Give me one poor request. / Hor. What is't, my lord? we will. / Ham. Never make known what you have seen to-night. / Both. My lord, we will not. / Ham. Nay, but swear't. / Hor. In faith, / My lord, not I. / Mar. Nor I, my lord, in faith. / Ham. Upon my sword. / Mar. We have sworn, my lord, already. / Ham. Indeed, upon my sword, indeed. / Ghost cries under the stage. / Ghost. Swear. / Ham. Ah, ha, boy! say'st thou so? art thou there, truepenny? / Come on,—you hear this fellow in the cellarage,— / Consent to swear. / Hor. Propose the oath, my lord. / Ham. Never to speak of this that you have seen, / Swear by my sword. / Ghost. [Beneath] Swear. / Ham. Hic et ubique? then we'll shift our ground. / Come hither, gentlemen, / And lay your hands again upon my sword: / Never to speak of this that you have heard, / Swear by my sword. / Ghost. [Beneath] Swear. / Ham. Well said, old mole! canst work i' the earth so fast? / A worthy pioner! Once more remove, good friends. / Hor. O day and night, but this is wondrous strange! / Ham. And therefore as a stranger give it welcome. / There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, / Than are dreamt of in your philosophy. / But come; / Here, as before, never, so help you mercy, / How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself, / As I perchance hereafter shall think meet / To put an antic disposition on, / That you, at such times seeing me, never shall, / With arms encumber'd thus, or this head-shake, / Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase, / As 'Well, well, we know,' or 'We could, an if we would,' / Or 'If we list to speak,' or 'There be, an if they might,' / Or such ambiguous giving out, to note / That you know aught of me: this not to do, / So grace and mercy at your most need help you, / Swear. / Ghost. [Beneath] Swear. / Ham. Rest, rest, perturbed spirit! [They swear.] So, gentlemen, / With all my love I do commend me to you: / And what so poor a man as Hamlet is / May do, to express his love and friending to you, / God willing, shall not lack. Let us go in together; / And still your fingers on your lips, I pray. / The time is out of joint: O cursed spite, / That ever I was born to set it right! / Nay, come, let's go together.

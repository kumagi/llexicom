The prefix 'magneto-' comes from the word 'magnet', which originates from the Greek 'λίθος μαγνήτης' (lithos magnētēs) meaning 'stone of Magnesia' (a region in ancient Greece). The word 'machine' comes from the Greek 'μηχανή' (mēkhanē) meaning 'device' or 'contrivance'.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/mæɡˌniːtoʊməˈʃiːn/","syllables":"mag-ne-to-ma-chine"},"inflection":{"noun_plural":"magnetomachines"},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"The term 'magnetomachine' is primarily used in speculative or fictional contexts.

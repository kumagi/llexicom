It refers to the action of removing a previously assigned value from a variable or environment variable. This makes the variable undefined or null, meaning it no longer holds any specific data. It's important to note that unsetting a variable can have consequences for the program's behavior, especially if other parts of the code rely on that variable's value.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The sun unsets in the east.","correct":"✓ The sun sets in the west.","note":"'Unset' (in the programming sense) should not be confused with the verb 'set' referring to the setting of the sun.

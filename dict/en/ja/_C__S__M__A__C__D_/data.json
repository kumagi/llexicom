It works by having each device listen for a carrier signal before transmitting. If a carrier signal is detected, the device waits before transmitting. If no carrier signal is detected, the device transmits. If two devices transmit at the same time, a collision occurs, and both devices stop transmitting and wait a random amount of time before trying again.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{},"related_words":{"derivatives":["CSMA","Ethernet","collision"],"phrasal_verbs":[]},"level_frequency":{},"readability_explanation":{"level":"Advanced","text":"CSMACD is a technical term related to computer networking.

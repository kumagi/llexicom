'Burden' comes from Old English 'byrden,' meaning 'load' or 'weight.' Thus, 'unburden' literally means to remove a load or weight, and figuratively, to relieve someone of a worry or problem.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/ʌnˈbɜːrdənɪŋ/","syllables":"un-bur-den-ing"},"inflection":{"verb_forms":{"present_simple":["unburden","unburdens"],"past_simple":"unburdened","past_participle":"unburdened","present_participle":"unburdening"},"noun_plural":"unburdenings"},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Unburdening' typically refers to the act of relieving oneself or someone else of a mental or emotional burden, such as worries, anxieties, secrets, or responsibilities.

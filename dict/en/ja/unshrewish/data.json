It is formed by adding the prefix \"un-\" to \"shrewish,\" which means \"having the characteristics of a shrew\" (a scolding, nagging woman). Therefore, \"unshrewish\" means \"not shrewish\" or lacking those negative qualities. Because of its rarity and the need to understand the meaning of \"shrewish\" first, this word is best suited for advanced English learners. It is important to use it in contexts where the meaning is clear, as it is not a commonly recognized term."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"Her unshrewish nature made her a beloved member of the community.","translation":"彼女のしとやかでない性格は、彼女を地域社会で愛される存在にした。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"しとやかでない"},{"sentence":"Despite the challenges, she remained remarkably unshrewish.","translation":"困難にもかかわらず、彼女は驚くほどしとやかでなかった。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"しとやかでない"}]}

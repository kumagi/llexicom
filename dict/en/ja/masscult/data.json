It refers to entertainment and cultural products designed for the widest possible audience – things like popular movies, television shows, best-selling books, and easily digestible music.  Greenberg saw it as largely undifferentiated from advertising and aimed at simple pleasures rather than aesthetic or intellectual depth.  It contrasts with \"high culture\" (opera, classical music, fine art) which he considered more demanding and valuable. However, the term is often used critically to suggest a decline in artistic standards due to commercial pressures."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The rise of reality television exemplifies the dominance of **masscult** in contemporary society.","translation":"リアリティ番組の隆盛は、現代社会における大衆文化の支配を例示している。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"general usage"},{"sentence":"Greenberg argued that **masscult** eroded the distinction between art and entertainment.","translation":"グリーンバーグは、大衆文化が芸術と娯楽の区別を曖昧にすると主張した。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"critical theory"},{"sentence":"Critics often bemoan the superficiality of **masscult** products.","translation":"批評家たちはしばしば大衆文化製品の表面的な性質を嘆く。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"general usage"}]}

It's a fairly technical term, mostly used in fields like computer science or genetics where arranging things in the correct order is important. If something has high \"sequenceability,\" it means it's easy to put it into a defined sequence. The word is formed by adding the suffixes \"-able\" (meaning 'able to be') and \"-ity\" (meaning 'the state of being') to the word \"sequence.\""},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The sequenceability of the DNA fragments was essential for reconstructing the entire genome.","translation":"DNA断片の配列可能性は、ゲノム全体の再構築に不可欠でした。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"ability to be sequenced"},{"sentence":"The software improved the sequenceability of the data, making it easier to analyze.","translation":"そのソフトウェアはデータの配列可能性を向上させ、分析を容易にしました。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"ability to be sequenced"}]}

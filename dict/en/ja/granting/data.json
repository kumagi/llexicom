This in turn comes from the Latin word 'credere' meaning 'to believe, trust'. The present participle form 'granting' is used to indicate an ongoing action or a conditional clause.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/ˈɡræntɪŋ/","syllables":"grant-ing"},"inflection":{"notes":"'Granting' is the present participle and gerund form of the verb 'grant'. As a conjunction, 'granting that' remains unchanged."},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Granting' can function as both a verb form and a conjunction. As a verb form (present participle), it describes the action of giving, permitting, or conceding. As a conjunction (usually in the form 'granting that' or 'granting as'), it introduces a clause that concedes a point for the sake of argument, similar to 'assuming that' or 'even if'.

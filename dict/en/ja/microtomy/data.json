It involves embedding the sample in a support medium (such as paraffin or resin), and then using a microtome to cut extremely thin slices (sections) of the sample. These sections are then mounted on microscope slides, stained, and examined under a microscope. The quality of the microtomy process is crucial for obtaining accurate and reliable results.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The microtomy was done by hand.","correct":"✓ The sectioning was done by hand. / ✓ The microtome was operated by hand.","note":"'Microtomy' refers to the process, not the instrument or the resulting section.

Understanding it requires familiarity with the concept of 'spiritualisation,' which refers to the process of imbuing something with spiritual qualities or interpreting it in a spiritual manner. The prefix 'un-' negates this, indicating a lack of spiritual character or interpretation. Due to its abstract nature and limited usage, this word is best suited for advanced learners and those engaged in specialized fields of study."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The art critic argued that the painting was merely decorative and remained stubbornly unspiritualised.","translation":"その美術評論家は、その絵画は単なる装飾であり、頑固に精神化されていないと主張した。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"Lacking spiritual quality"},{"sentence":"The philosopher warned against an unspiritualised approach to technology, emphasizing the need for ethical considerations.","translation":"その哲学者は、技術に対する精神性のないアプローチに警告し、倫理的配慮の必要性を強調した。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"Lacking spiritual quality"}]}

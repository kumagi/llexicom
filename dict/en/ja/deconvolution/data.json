Convolution is a mathematical operation that combines two functions to produce a third function that expresses how the shape of one is modified by the other. In many practical applications, such as image processing, the observed data is a convolution of the true signal with a blurring function (also known as a point spread function). Deconvolution aims to estimate the true signal by removing the effects of this blurring. Deconvolution is widely used in various fields, including image processing, signal processing, seismology, and astronomy.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The deconvolution was applied to the signal, but it didn't improve.","correct":"✓ Deconvolution was applied to the signal, but it didn't improve the result.","note":"\"Deconvolution\" itself is a process, not a physical object.

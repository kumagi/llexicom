'Transpire' originally meant 'to emit as vapor' (from Latin 'transpirare,' to breathe across or through), but later developed the sense 'to become known' or 'to happen.' Thus, 'untranspiring' can mean either 'not emitting' or, more figuratively, 'not becoming known or evident.'","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/ˌʌntrænˈspaɪərɪŋ/","syllables":"un-trans-pir-ing"},"inflection":{"notes":"Comparative and superlative forms are generally not used. Adverbial form: untranspiringly."},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Untranspiring' is a relatively rare and somewhat formal word. It is primarily used to describe a person's face, expression, or demeanor as lacking any visible emotion or reaction. It suggests a deliberate withholding of feelings or an inherent impassivity.

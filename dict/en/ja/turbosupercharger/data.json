This allows the engine to burn more fuel and produce more power.

It refers to a system that forces more air into the engine to increase power. It is more complex than a simple 'supercharger' because it uses exhaust gases to power a turbine, which in turn drives the compressor. Understanding this term requires some knowledge of engine mechanics."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The mechanic explained how the turbosupercharger works in the engine.","translation":"整備士はエンジン内のターボスーパーチャージャーの仕組みを説明した。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"description"},{"sentence":"Upgrading to a turbosupercharger significantly improved the car's acceleration.","translation":"ターボスーパーチャージャーにアップグレードしたことで、車の加速が大幅に向上した。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"performance"}]}

It refers to the process of making fine adjustments to a telescope's tracking mechanism to ensure that it remains accurately pointed at a celestial object during long exposures. This is necessary because no telescope drive is perfectly accurate, and atmospheric turbulence can also cause the image to drift.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ I am reguiding the car.","correct":"✓ I am steering the car.","note":"'Reguiding' is specific to telescopes and astronomical observations.

It is used in specialized contexts, particularly in medicine or audiology, to describe someone who retains their hearing ability. Because it's a negation of a condition (deafness), it's less commonly used than the simpler term 'hearing'. It's important to understand the context in which it is used, as it implies a specific focus on the preservation or presence of hearing.

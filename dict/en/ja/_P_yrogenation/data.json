It refers to the thermal decomposition of organic materials at high temperatures in an environment with limited or no oxygen. This process is distinct from combustion (burning), which requires oxygen. The products of pyrogenation can include solids (e.g., charcoal), liquids (e.g., bio-oil), and gases (e.g., syngas), depending on the specific conditions and feedstock used.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Pyrogenation is the same as combustion.","correct":"✓ Pyrogenation is different from combustion because it occurs with limited or no oxygen.","note":"Pyrogenation requires limited or no oxygen, while combustion requires oxygen."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["pyrolyze (verb)","pyrolysis (noun)","pyrolytic (adjective)"],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Pyrogenation' is a specialized term related to chemical processes.

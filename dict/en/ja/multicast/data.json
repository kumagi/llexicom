It refers to a method of sending data from one source to a specific group of recipients on a network. Unlike 'unicast,' which sends data to a single recipient, or 'broadcast,' which sends data to everyone on the network, 'multicast' is more efficient for applications where the same data needs to be sent to multiple, but not all, users simultaneously, such as video streaming or software updates. Understanding 'multicast' requires some knowledge of networking concepts."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The company uses multicast to efficiently distribute software updates to its servers.","translation":"その企業は、マルチキャストを使用して、ソフトウェアアップデートをサーバーに効率的に配布しています。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"(ネットワーク) マルチキャスト"},{"sentence":"The router is configured to multicast the video stream to the set-top boxes.","translation":"ルーターは、ビデオストリームをセットトップボックスにマルチキャストするように構成されています。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"(ネットワーク) マルチキャストする"}]}

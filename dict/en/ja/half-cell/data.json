It refers to one half of an electrochemical cell, which is a system that converts chemical energy into electrical energy or vice versa. A half-cell consists of an electrode (a conductor) immersed in an electrolyte (a solution containing ions). In a half-cell, either oxidation (loss of electrons) or reduction (gain of electrons) occurs. Two half-cells are needed to create a complete electrochemical cell. Understanding the concept of a half-cell requires knowledge of basic chemistry principles, including oxidation-reduction reactions and electrochemistry.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The **half-cell** reaction at the anode involves oxidation.","translation":"アノードでの**半電池**反応は酸化を伴います。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"半電池 (電気化学)"},{"sentence":"The **half-cell** potential is dependent on the concentration of ions in the electrolyte.","translation":"**半電池**電位は、電解質中のイオンの濃度に依存します。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"半電池 (電気化学)"},{"sentence":"A silver chloride electrode is often used as a reference **half-cell**.","translation":"塩化銀電極は、参照**半電池**としてよく使用されます。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"半電池 (電気化学)"}]}

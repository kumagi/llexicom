Materials with high crystallinity tend to be stronger, more rigid, and less transparent than amorphous materials. The degree of crystallinity can be controlled through various processing techniques, such as annealing or quenching.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"The material has a very crystal.","correct":"The material has a high crystallinity.","note":"'Crystal' refers to a single crystal or a crystalline substance, while 'crystallinity' refers to the degree of crystalline structure within a material."},{"incorrect":"The crystallinity is measure by microscope.","correct":"The crystallinity is measured by microscopy.","note":"Microscopy is the general technique.

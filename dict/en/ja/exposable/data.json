It is less common than 'exposed,' which describes the *state* of being uncovered or revealed. 'Exposable' is often used in technical or specialized contexts where the capability of being exposed is relevant. For example, in photography, film is described as 'exposable' to light. In cybersecurity, data might be described as 'exposable' due to a vulnerability. It's important to distinguish between 'exposable' (capable of being exposed) and 'exposed' (currently uncovered or revealed)."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The sensor is highly exposable to electromagnetic interference.","translation":"そのセンサーは電磁干渉に非常にさらされやすい。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"Capable of being exposed"},{"sentence":"The vulnerability made user data exposable to hackers.","translation":"その脆弱性により、ユーザーデータがハッカーに暴露可能になった。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"Able to be revealed"},{"sentence":"This area of the skin is more exposable to sunlight.","translation":"この皮膚の領域は、日光にさらされやすい。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"Capable of being exposed"}]}

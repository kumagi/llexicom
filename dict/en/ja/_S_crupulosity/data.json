It is often associated with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). People with scrupulosity may worry excessively about having committed sins or violated moral principles, even when there is no objective reason to believe they have done so. This can lead to compulsive behaviors such as excessive confession, prayer, or reassurance-seeking. It is important to note that scrupulosity is distinct from genuine moral concern or conscientiousness.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ He showed great scrupulousity in his work.","correct":"✓ He showed great scrupulousness in his work.","note":"The correct word for general carefulness is \"scrupulousness,\" not \"scrupulosity,\" which refers specifically to pathological moral anxiety."},{"incorrect":"✗ She was scrupulosity about her diet.","correct":"✓ She was scrupulous about her diet.","note":"Use \"scrupulous\" (adjective) to describe someone who is generally careful and conscientious. \"Scrupulosity\" is a noun referring to the specific condition of excessive moral anxiety."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["scrupulous (adjective)","scrupulously (adverb)"],"phrasal_verbs":[],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"\"Scrupulosity\" is a relatively uncommon word that describes a psychological condition involving excessive worry about whether one's actions are morally right.

Erosion is the process of wearing away or gradually destroying something by the action of wind, water, or other natural agents. So, if something is \"nonerosive,\" it means it resists this wearing-away process. This word is mainly used in scientific or engineering contexts when discussing materials, soil, or construction.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The new polymer coating is designed to be completely nonerosive, even in harsh chemical environments.","translation":"新しいポリマーコーティングは、過酷な化学環境下でも完全に非侵食性になるように設計されている。","type":"general","meaning_category":"resistant to erosion"},{"sentence":"Farmers are using nonerosive farming techniques to protect the topsoil.","translation":"農家は表土を保護するために、非侵食性の農業技術を使用している。","type":"general","meaning_category":"not causing erosion"},{"sentence":"The nonerosive properties of the stone make it ideal for building foundations.","translation":"その石の非侵食性の特性は、建物の基礎に最適である。","type":"technical","meaning_category":"resistant to erosion"}]}

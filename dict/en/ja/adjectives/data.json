They provide details about the noun's qualities, characteristics, or attributes. They can indicate color, size, shape, texture, origin, or other qualities. In English, adjectives typically precede the noun they modify, but they can also follow linking verbs (e.g., 'is', 'are', 'was', 'were', 'seems', 'becomes'). There are different types of adjectives, including descriptive adjectives (which describe qualities), limiting adjectives (which specify quantity or number), and proper adjectives (which are derived from proper nouns).","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ He is a tall.","correct":"✓ He is tall. / ✓ He is a tall man.","note":"Adjectives cannot stand alone after a linking verb without a noun.

They tell you more about a person, place, thing, or idea. For example, in the phrase 'a big house,' the word 'big' is an adjective because it describes the house. Adjectives help make your writing and speaking more interesting and detailed. You can use them to describe colors, sizes, feelings, and many other things. Learning to use adjectives correctly will improve your English skills.","priority":"★☆☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The **tall** building dominates the skyline.","translation":"その高い建物が地平線を際立たせている。","type":"descriptive adjective","meaning_category":"高さ"},{"sentence":"She wore a **beautiful** dress to the party.","translation":"彼女はパーティーに美しいドレスを着ていった。","type":"descriptive adjective","meaning_category":"美しさ"},{"sentence":"I have **two** cats.","translation":"私は猫を２匹飼っています。","type":"limiting adjective","meaning_category":"数"},{"sentence":"The **American** flag is red, white, and blue.","translation":"アメリカの国旗は赤、白、青です。","type":"proper adjective","meaning_category":"国籍"},{"sentence":"He is **happy**.","translation":"彼は幸せです。","type":"descriptive adjective (predicative)","meaning_category":"感情"}]}

Think of it as the opposite of being 'dramatic' or 'rhetorical.' It suggests a plain, straightforward, and unembellished style of communication. Because it's a less common word, it's important to understand the meaning of 'declamatory' first, and then recognize that 'undeclamatory' simply negates that quality."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The witness gave an undeclamatory account of the events, sticking to the facts.","translation":"証人は、事実に固執し、大げさでない出来事の説明をした。","type":"general","meaning_category":"not oratorical"},{"sentence":"The professor's undeclamatory lectures, while informative, often failed to capture the students' attention.","translation":"教授の飾り気のない講義は、有益ではあったものの、学生の注意を引くことはほとんどなかった。","type":"general","meaning_category":"straightforward"}]}

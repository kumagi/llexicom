This provides improved traction and handling, especially in adverse conditions like snow, ice, or off-road terrain. It is often used interchangeably with 4WD (Four-Wheel Drive), although there are technical differences. AWD is generally considered to be more suitable for on-road use and automatic engagement, while 4WD is often designed for more rugged off-road applications and may require manual engagement.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ My car is Awd.","correct":"✓ My car is AWD.","note":"AWD is an abbreviation and should be capitalized."},{"incorrect":"✗ AWD is better than all cars.","correct":"✓ AWD is better than some cars.","note":"AWD is not universally better than all cars; its advantages depend on the specific conditions and needs of the driver."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":[],"phrasal_verbs":[],"related_terms":["4WD (Four-Wheel Drive)","2WD (Two-Wheel Drive)","FWD (Front-Wheel Drive)","RWD (Rear-Wheel Drive)","drivetrain","traction","handling"],"priority":"★★★"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"B2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"B2","text":"AWD stands for All-Wheel Drive. It's a system in cars where all four wheels get power from the engine. This helps the car grip the road better, especially when it's slippery, like in snow or mud. AWD is similar to 4WD (Four-Wheel Drive), but AWD usually works automatically, while 4WD might need you to turn it on. AWD is good for driving on roads that aren't always perfect, but it might not be as strong as 4WD for really tough off-road driving.","example_sentences":[]},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The new SUV features an advanced AWD system for enhanced stability.","translation":"その新型SUVは、安定性を高めるための高度なAWDシステムを搭載しています。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"全輪駆動"},{"sentence":"Many drivers prefer AWD for its superior handling in winter conditions.","translation":"多くのドライバーは、冬の状況での優れたハンドリングのためにAWDを好みます。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"全輪駆動"}]}

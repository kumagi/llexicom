Because it's not a very common word, it's more likely to appear in formal writing or speech where emphasizing the unity of action is important. It's less frequent in everyday conversation. You can often replace it with phrases like \"together\" or \"as one\" without significantly changing the meaning, but \"unitedly\" adds a stronger emphasis on the cohesive nature of the action."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The citizens responded **unitedly** to the call for help after the disaster.","translation":"市民たちは災害後の支援要請に団結して応えた。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"団結して"},{"sentence":"The nations condemned the act of aggression **unitedly**.","translation":"各国は侵略行為を一致して非難した。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"一致して"},{"sentence":"The artists collaborated **unitedly** on the mural project.","translation":"芸術家たちは壁画プロジェクトに共同で協力した。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"共同で"}]}

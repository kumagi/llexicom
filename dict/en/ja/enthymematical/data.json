An enthymeme is a type of syllogism (a logical argument) where one or more premises or the conclusion are not explicitly stated, but rather implied or assumed. This makes the argument more concise but can also make it less clear or more open to interpretation. Enthymematical arguments are common in everyday speech and writing, where people often leave out information that they assume their audience already knows or can easily infer.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The poem was very enthymemetic.","correct":"✓ The poem was very enthymematical.","note":"The correct adjective form is \"enthymematical,\" not \"enthymemetic.\" Although \"enthymeme\" is the noun, the adjective requires the \"-atical\" suffix."},{"incorrect":"✗ He used enthymematical to persuade them.","correct":"✓ He used enthymematical reasoning to persuade them.","note":"\"Enthymematical\" is an adjective, so it must modify a noun.

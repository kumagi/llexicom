It's not commonly used outside of advanced chemistry contexts. To understand it, you need to know that chemical bonds are made of electrons shared between atoms. In heterolysis, when the bond breaks, one atom takes both electrons, forming ions (charged atoms). This is different from 'homolysis' where each atom takes one electron, forming radicals.","priority":"★☆☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The heterolysis of water can lead to the formation of hydronium and hydroxide ions.","translation":"水の異種開裂は、ヒドロニウムイオンと水酸化物イオンの生成につながる可能性がある。","type":"general","meaning_category":"chemical reaction"},{"sentence":"The S<sub>N</sub>1 reaction mechanism involves heterolysis as the first step.","translation":"S<sub>N</sub>1反応機構は、最初のステップとして異種開裂を伴う。","type":"specific","meaning_category":"reaction mechanism"}]}

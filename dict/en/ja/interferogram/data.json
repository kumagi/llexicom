These patterns are created when two or more waves (like light or radio waves) combine. Scientists and engineers use interferograms to measure very small changes in distance, surface shape, or other properties of materials. The patterns in the interferogram can tell them a lot about the object or phenomenon they are studying. This term is most often used in physics, optics, and engineering contexts.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The researchers used an interferogram to measure the thickness of the thin film.","translation":"研究者たちは干渉図を用いて薄膜の厚さを測定した。","type":"general","meaning_category":"measurement"},{"sentence":"The satellite interferogram revealed significant ground subsidence in the area.","translation":"衛星干渉図は、その地域における著しい地盤沈下を明らかにした。","type":"general","meaning_category":"remote sensing"},{"sentence":"The optical interferogram showed a high degree of surface smoothness.","translation":"光学干渉図は、高い表面平滑度を示した。","type":"general","meaning_category":"optics"}]}

These cells are crucial components of the immune system, defending the body against infections and diseases. The process involves the differentiation and maturation of hematopoietic stem cells into various leukocyte lineages, including granulocytes (neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils), monocytes, and lymphocytes (T cells, B cells, NK cells). Dysregulation of leukopoiesis can result in conditions such as leukopenia (reduced white blood cell count) or leukemia (uncontrolled proliferation of abnormal white blood cells).","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Leukopoiesis is the same as erythropoiesis.","correct":"✓ Leukopoiesis is the production of white blood cells, while erythropoiesis is the production of red blood cells.","note":"Leukopoiesis refers to the formation of white blood cells, whereas erythropoiesis refers to the formation of red blood cells.

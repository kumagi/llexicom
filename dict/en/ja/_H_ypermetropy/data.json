This occurs because the eyeball is too short or the cornea is too flat, causing light to focus behind the retina. It's commonly corrected with glasses or contact lenses that have convex (positive) lenses.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ I have hypermetropy, so I can see well near.","correct":"✓ I have hypermetropy, so I can't see well near.","note":"Hypermetropy causes difficulty seeing near objects, not seeing them well."},{"incorrect":"✗ Hypermetropy is when you can see far away objects blurry.","correct":"✓ Hypermetropy is when you can see near objects blurry.","note":"Hypermetropy (farsightedness) means distant objects are clear, and near objects are blurry.

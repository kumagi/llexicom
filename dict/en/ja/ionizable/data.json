Ions are atoms or molecules that have gained or lost electrons, giving them an electrical charge. A substance is ionizable if it can form these charged particles when dissolved in a solvent or under certain conditions. This property is important for understanding the behavior of substances in solutions and their ability to conduct electricity."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"Acids are ionizable in water, producing hydrogen ions.","translation":"酸は水中でイオン化可能であり、水素イオンを生成します。","type":"general","meaning_category":"general"},{"sentence":"The degree to which a compound is ionizable affects its biological activity.","translation":"化合物がイオン化される程度は、その生物活性に影響を与えます。","type":"scientific","meaning_category":"scientific"}]}

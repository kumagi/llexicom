It bisects the I band, which is the region of the sarcomere containing only thin filaments (actin). The distance between successive Ilines defines the length of a sarcomere. During muscle contraction, the thin filaments slide past the thick filaments (myosin), causing the I band and, consequently, the distance between Ilines to shorten.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The H zone is in the middle of the Iline.","correct":"✓ The M line is in the middle of the H zone.","note":"The M line is located in the center of the H zone, while the Iline is in the center of the I band."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":[],"phrasal_verbs":[],"related_terms":["sarcomere","I band","A band","Z disc","M line","actin","myosin","muscle fiber","striated muscle","muscle contraction"],"priority":"★★★"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2 (specialized vocabulary)","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency (specialized scientific term)","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C2","text":"The term 'Iline' is a highly specialized term used in the context of muscle anatomy and physiology.

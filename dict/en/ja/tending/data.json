'Tend' comes from the Middle English word 'tenden', which in turn comes from the Old French word 'tendre', meaning 'to stretch, extend, direct'. This ultimately derives from the Latin word 'tendere', meaning 'to stretch, extend, aim for'. The sense of 'caring for' developed from the idea of directing one's efforts towards something.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/ˈtendɪŋ/","syllables":"tend-ing"},"inflection":{"verb_forms":{"present_simple":["tend","tends"],"past_simple":"tended","past_participle":"tended","present_participle":"tending"}},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Tending' has two main meanings, both derived from the verb 'tend'. The first meaning relates to a general inclination or likelihood, often used with 'to'. The second meaning refers to the act of caring for something, such as a garden, animals, or people who are sick. When used as a noun, 'tending' refers to the act of providing care or attention.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ He is tending to be late always.","correct":"✓ He tends to be late. / ✓ He is tending to be late more often recently.","note":"The adverb 'always' is generally used with the simple present tense ('tends'). The present continuous ('is tending') suggests a more recent or temporary trend."},{"incorrect":"✗ She is tending the garden with happy.","correct":"✓ She is tending the garden happily.","note":"Use an adverb ('happily') to describe how the action of tending is performed, not an adjective ('happy')."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["tendency (noun: a predisposition to behave in a certain way)","tender (verb: to offer or present something)","attendant (noun: someone who provides a service)"],"phrasal_verbs":["tend to (to be likely to do or be something)"],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"B1","frequency_google_ngram":"Relatively frequent","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"B1","text":"'Tending' is the present participle of 'tend', which has two main meanings.

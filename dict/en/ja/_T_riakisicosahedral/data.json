It is formed by taking an icosahedron (a 20-sided polyhedron) and adding a triangular pyramid to each of its faces, resulting in a solid with 60 triangular faces. It's a Catalan solid, which means it's a convex polyhedron with regular faces that aren't regular polygons.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{},"related_words":{"derivatives":["triakis icosahedron"],"related_terms":["icosahedron","Catalan solid","polyhedron"],"priority":"★★★"},"level_frequency":{},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C2","text":"The word 'triakisicosahedral' is a highly technical term used in geometry.

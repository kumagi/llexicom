It can also be used as part of a function name in programming (e.g., 'async function')."},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"In computing, 'async' is commonly used to describe operations or functions that allow a program to continue executing other tasks while waiting for a long-running operation (like network requests or file I/O) to complete. This prevents the program from freezing or becoming unresponsive. 'Async' is often used in conjunction with 'await' in programming languages like JavaScript and Python to handle asynchronous operations in a more readable and manageable way.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The process is asyncronous.","correct":"✓ The process is asynchronous. / ✓ The process is async.","note":"The correct spelling is 'asynchronous' or the shortened form 'async'.

It describes a way of running code where tasks can happen independently, rather than one after the other. This is useful for preventing a program from freezing while waiting for something to finish, like loading data from the internet. It's an advanced concept, so you'll mostly encounter it in technical discussions or documentation.

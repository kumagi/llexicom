It refers to the violation of parity symmetry, meaning that a physical system does not behave the same way when its spatial coordinates are inverted. This concept is most commonly encountered when discussing weak interactions. Outside of physics, the term is rarely used. In computer science, it might refer to data transmission without parity bits for error detection, but this usage is less common. Understanding the concept requires familiarity with physics terminology and concepts of symmetry.","example_sentences":[]}}

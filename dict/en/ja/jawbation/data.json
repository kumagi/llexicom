It combines the idea of 'jawing' (talking at length) with a more obscure term, 'orbatation' (deprivation), to create a playful term for a tedious or pointless discussion. Due to its rarity and somewhat contrived nature, it's best used sparingly and with awareness of the audience's vocabulary. It would likely be understood only by those with a very broad and sophisticated vocabulary.","priority":"★☆☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The committee meeting dissolved into a tedious jawbation about the color of the new stationery.","translation":"委員会は、新しい文房具の色に関する退屈な長々とした議論に崩壊した。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"lengthy discussion"},{"sentence":"After hours of jawbation, they still hadn't reached a decision.","translation":"何時間もの長々とした議論の後、彼らはまだ決定に達していなかった。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"tedious argument"}]}

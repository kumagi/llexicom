It is the active form of vitamin B1 (thiamine) and plays a key role in reactions such as the decarboxylation of pyruvate and alpha-ketoglutarate. Deficiency in diphosphothiamine can lead to serious health issues, including beriberi and Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[],"priority":"☆☆☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["thiamine","thiamine pyrophosphate kinase"],"phrasal_verbs":[]},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency","priority":"☆☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C2","text":"'Diphosphothiamine' is a technical term used in biochemistry and nutrition.

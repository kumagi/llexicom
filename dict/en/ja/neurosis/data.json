It's an older term that's less common in modern psychiatric diagnoses, but it's still used in general discussions about mental health. A key feature of neurosis is that it doesn't involve a loss of touch with reality, unlike psychosis. The term is often used to describe persistent patterns of worrying, fear, or other negative emotions that interfere with daily life. It is important to note that modern psychiatric classifications use more specific diagnoses, such as anxiety disorders or obsessive-compulsive disorder, rather than the broad term 'neurosis'."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"His fear of public speaking stemmed from a deep-seated neurosis.","translation":"彼のスピーチ恐怖症は根深い神経症から来ていた。","type":"general","meaning_category":"general"},{"sentence":"Psychoanalysis aims to uncover the root causes of a patient's neurosis.","translation":"精神分析は、患者の神経症の根本原因を明らかにすることを目的としている。","type":"therapy","meaning_category":"therapy"},{"sentence":"She recognized that her excessive cleaning was a manifestation of her neurosis.","translation":"彼女は、自分の過剰な清掃が神経症の表れであることを認識した。","type":"behavior","meaning_category":"behavior"}]}

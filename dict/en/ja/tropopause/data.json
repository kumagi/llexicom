It marks the end of the troposphere, where temperature generally decreases with height, and the beginning of the stratosphere, where temperature either remains constant or increases with height. The tropopause height is higher in the tropics and lower at the poles, and it also varies with the seasons. It acts as a lid, preventing much of the mixing between the troposphere and the stratosphere.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The tropopause is in the ocean.","correct":"✓ The tropopause is in the atmosphere.","note":"The tropopause is a layer in the atmosphere, not in the ocean."},{"incorrect":"✗ The tropopause is the same height everywhere.","correct":"✓ The tropopause height varies with latitude and season.","note":"The height of the tropopause is not constant; it changes depending on location and time of year."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["tropopausal (adjective)"],"phrasal_verbs":[],"related_terms":["troposphere","stratosphere","atmosphere","temperature inversion"]},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"The term 'tropopause' refers to the boundary layer between the troposphere and the stratosphere in the Earth's atmosphere.

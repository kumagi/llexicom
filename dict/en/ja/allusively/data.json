'Allude' originates from the Latin 'alludere,' meaning 'to play with, jest, refer to playfully,' from 'ad-' (to) + 'ludere' (to play). The adverbial form 'allusively' is created by adding the suffix '-ly' to 'allusive.'","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/əˈluːsɪvli/","syllables":"al-lu-sive-ly"},"inflection":{"notes":"Adverbs do not typically inflect."},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Allusively' describes a manner of communication that relies on indirect references, hints, or suggestions rather than explicit statements. It is often used when the speaker or writer wants to evoke a particular idea, feeling, or association without stating it directly. This can add layers of meaning and complexity to the communication, inviting the audience to engage in interpretation. However, it can also lead to ambiguity or misunderstanding if the allusions are not recognized or understood by the audience.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ He allusively denied the accusation.","correct":"✓ He indirectly denied the accusation.","note":"While 'allusively' can imply denial, it focuses on the manner of speaking.

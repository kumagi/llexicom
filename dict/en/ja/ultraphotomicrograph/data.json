This type of microscopy is used to visualize extremely small objects, often at the nanoscale, that are beyond the resolution limits of conventional light microscopy. Ultraphotomicrographs are valuable in scientific research, particularly in fields like virology, materials science, and nanotechnology, where detailed visualization of minute structures is essential.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ I saw an ultraphotomicrography of the cell.","correct":"✓ I saw an ultraphotomicrograph of the cell.","note":"Ultraphotomicrograph is the noun (the photograph itself), while ultraphotomicrography is the process or technique of taking such photographs."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["ultramicroscope","photomicrography","microscopy"],"phrasal_verbs":[]},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Very low frequency","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C2","text":"The term 'ultraphotomicrograph' is highly technical and specific to advanced microscopy.

It refers to a major division of the animal kingdom distinguished by a specific pattern of embryonic development. Specifically, in deuterostomes, the blastopore (the initial opening formed during gastrulation) develops into the anus, while the mouth forms secondarily. This term is typically encountered in advanced biology courses or scientific literature. Understanding this term requires familiarity with basic concepts of embryology and animal classification."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The Deuterostomata include diverse phyla such as chordates and echinoderms.","translation":"後口動物には、脊索動物や棘皮動物などの多様な門が含まれる。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"classification"},{"sentence":"In Deuterostomata, radial cleavage is common during embryonic development.","translation":"後口動物では、放射状卵割が胚発生中に一般的である。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"embryonic development"}]}

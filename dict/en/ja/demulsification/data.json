It describes the process of separating an emulsion, which is a mixture of two or more liquids that are normally immiscible (unmixable). Understanding this term requires familiarity with concepts in chemistry and engineering, particularly related to fluid dynamics and phase separation. The term is most often encountered in fields dealing with oil and water mixtures, such as petroleum refining and wastewater treatment."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"Efficient demulsification is crucial for the effective treatment of oily wastewater.","translation":"効率的な解乳化は、油性廃水の効果的な処理に不可欠である。","type":"general","meaning_category":"Process of separating an emulsion"},{"sentence":"The addition of the demulsifier resulted in rapid demulsification of the crude oil emulsion.","translation":"解乳剤の添加により、原油エマルションの迅速な解乳化が起こった。","type":"technical","meaning_category":"Breaking down an emulsion"}]}

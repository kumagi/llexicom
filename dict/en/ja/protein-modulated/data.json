It indicates that a protein plays a role in influencing or changing a specific biological process, function, or structure. The modulation can be direct, where the protein interacts directly with the target, or indirect, where the protein influences other factors that then affect the target. The term is often used to describe complex biological systems where protein interactions are crucial for regulation.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The modulated protein.","correct":"✓ The protein-modulated process.","note":"'Protein-modulated' is typically used to describe the thing being affected (e.g., a process, a function), not the protein itself.

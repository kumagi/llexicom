A 'spline' itself is a ridge or key on a shaft that fits into a corresponding groove in a hub or mating part, used to transmit torque. The term likely evolved from earlier uses of 'spline' referring to thin strips of wood or metal used in construction or joining.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/ˈsplaɪnd/","syllables":"splined"},"inflection":{"verb_forms":{"present_simple":["spline","splines"],"past_simple":"splined","past_participle":"splined","present_participle":"splining"},"notes":"As an adjective, it does not inflect.

It describes a component or part that has been manufactured with splines, which are ridges or teeth used to connect rotating parts. The term can function as both an adjective (e.g., 'splined shaft') and a past participle of the verb 'spline' (e.g., 'the shaft was splined'). The presence of splines ensures a strong and reliable connection for transmitting torque.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The shaft was line.","correct":"✓ The shaft was splined.","note":"'Splined' is the correct term to describe a shaft that has been machined with splines.

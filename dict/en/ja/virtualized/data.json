Think of it like a digital copy of a physical thing. This is often done to make things more efficient and easier to manage. For example, instead of having many physical servers, a company might use virtualized servers, which are software-based versions of servers that run on a smaller number of physical machines. This makes it easier to allocate resources and saves money.

It has two main meanings: 'Electromagnetic Field' and 'Electromotive Force'. The context usually makes it clear which meaning is intended. 'Electromagnetic Field' refers to the field of energy surrounding electrical devices, and is often discussed in relation to potential health effects. 'Electromotive Force' is a measure of the energy that a source of electricity, like a battery, can provide. Understanding the context is key to interpreting the meaning of 'EMF'.

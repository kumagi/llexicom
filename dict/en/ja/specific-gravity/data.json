It is a ratio, comparing the density of a substance to the density of a reference substance. For liquids and solids, the reference substance is usually water (at a specified temperature, often 4 °C). For gases, the reference substance is often air at a specified temperature and pressure. A specific gravity greater than 1 indicates that the substance is denser than the reference substance, while a specific gravity less than 1 indicates that it is less dense.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The specific gravity has units of g/cm³.","correct":"✓ Specific gravity is a dimensionless quantity and has no units.","note":"Specific gravity is a ratio and therefore dimensionless."},{"incorrect":"✗ Density and specific gravity are the same thing.","correct":"✓ Density and specific gravity are related, but density has units (e.g., g/cm³) while specific gravity is a ratio and dimensionless.","note":"Density is mass per unit volume, while specific gravity is the ratio of a substance's density to that of a reference substance."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["density","hydrometer","relative density"],"phrasal_verbs":[],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C1","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"The term 'specific gravity' is used in scientific and technical contexts, particularly in physics, chemistry, and engineering.

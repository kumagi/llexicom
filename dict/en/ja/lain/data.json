It's often used with auxiliary verbs like 'have' or 'had' to form perfect tenses (e.g., 'has lain,' 'had lain'). It is important to distinguish 'lie' (to recline) from 'lie' (to tell an untruth), as the latter has different forms (lie, lied, lied). Also, be careful not to confuse 'lie' (to recline) with 'lay' (to place something down), which is a transitive verb.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ He lay down for a nap, and has laid there for an hour.","correct":"✓ He lay down for a nap, and has lain there for an hour.","note":"The past participle of 'lie' (to recline) is 'lain,' not 'laid.'

Understanding the difference between the intransitive verb 'lie' (lie, lay, lain, lying) and the transitive verb 'lay' (lay, laid, laid, laying) is crucial. 'Lain' is used in perfect tenses to describe a state of being in a horizontal position over a period of time, or to indicate where responsibility or blame has resided. Due to its less frequent usage compared to other verb forms, mastering 'lain' requires careful attention to context and grammatical structure."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The cat had **lain** asleep in the sunbeam all afternoon.","translation":"猫は午後中ずっと日差しの中で眠っていた。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"横たわっていた"},{"sentence":"The problem has **lain** unresolved for many years.","translation":"その問題は何年も未解決のままだった。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"存在する"},{"sentence":"After the surgery, she **lain** in bed for a week to recover.","translation":"手術後、彼女は回復のために一週間ベッドに横になっていた。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"横たわっていた"},{"sentence":"The documents had **lain** hidden in the attic for decades.","translation":"その書類は何十年も屋根裏部屋に隠されていた。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"存在する"}]}

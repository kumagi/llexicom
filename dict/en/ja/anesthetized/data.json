First, it describes the state of a patient who has received anesthesia, typically for a medical procedure, resulting in a temporary loss of sensation or consciousness. Second, it can be used metaphorically to describe someone who is emotionally numb or detached, lacking the ability to feel or respond to emotions. This metaphorical use is less common but important to understand. The word is derived from 'anesthesia,' which means loss of sensation, and 'anesthetic,' which is the drug used to induce anesthesia.

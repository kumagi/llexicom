It describes situations where there is a limited amount of labeled data available for training supervised learning models. Labeled data is crucial for supervised learning, as it provides the correct output for each input, allowing the model to learn the relationship between inputs and outputs. When a dataset is label-poor, it can be challenging to train accurate and reliable models.

It describes a situation where there is not enough labeled data available to train a supervised learning model effectively. Labeled data refers to data that has been tagged with the correct answer or category, which the model uses to learn patterns and make predictions. When a dataset is \"label-poor,\" it means that only a small portion of the data has these labels, making it difficult for the model to learn accurately.

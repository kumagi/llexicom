Otherwise, it produces a true value. It is equivalent to the negation of the conjunction. NAND is significant because any other logical connective can be expressed by it; thus, it can be used to implement all other logical operations.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The nonconjunction is true when both statements are true.","correct":"✓ The nonconjunction is false when both statements are true.","note":"Nonconjunction is false only when both statements are true, otherwise it's true."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":[],"related_terms":["logic gate","boolean algebra","truth table","logical operator"],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency.

It's typically inherited, meaning it's passed down from parents to children through genes. The severity of hemophilia can vary, with some individuals experiencing mild bleeding episodes and others facing severe, life-threatening hemorrhages. Treatment usually involves replacing the missing clotting factors in the blood.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ He has hemophilia's.","correct":"✓ He has hemophilia.","note":"Hemophilia is usually used as an uncountable noun, so it doesn't take a plural form like 'hemophilias' in general usage, unless referring to different types of the condition.

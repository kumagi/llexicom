'Grainable' itself is derived from 'grain' (referring to the pattern or texture of wood or other materials) and the suffix '-able' (meaning 'capable of').","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/ʌnˈɡreɪnəbəl/","syllables":"un-grain-a-ble"},"inflection":{"notes":"Adjectives do not typically inflect except for comparative and superlative forms, which are less common for this word.","comparative":"more ungrainable","superlative":"most ungrainable"},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Ungrainable' is primarily used in technical or descriptive contexts related to materials science, manufacturing, and finishing processes. It describes a property of a substance that prevents it from being textured with a grain pattern, either naturally or artificially. The term is often used in contrast to 'grainable' materials, which can be treated to exhibit a wood-like or other textured appearance.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The wood was ungrainable.","correct":"✓ The wood was not grainable. / ✓ The wood had a very tight grain.","note":"Wood, by its nature, has a grain. Saying wood is 'ungrainable' is generally incorrect. You might say it has a tight grain or is difficult to grain further, but not that it lacks grain entirely."},{"incorrect":"✗ The ungrainability of the surface made it easy to clean.","correct":"✓ The smoothness of the surface made it easy to clean.","note":"'Ungrainability' is not a commonly used noun.

It refers to a state where a nuclear chain reaction is not self-sustaining, meaning it will die out over time. This is the opposite of \"criticality,\" where the reaction is self-sustaining. Achieving and maintaining non-criticality is vital for the safe operation and handling of nuclear materials.

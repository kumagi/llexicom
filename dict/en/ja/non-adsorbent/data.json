It is formed by adding the prefix 'non-' to 'adsorbent', which means 'able to adsorb'. Understanding this term requires knowledge of the concept of adsorption, which is the adhesion of atoms, ions, or molecules from a gas, liquid, or dissolved solid to a surface. Therefore, the readability level is relatively high."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The inner lining of the container is made of a non-adsorbent polymer to prevent loss of the active ingredient.","translation":"容器の内側のライニングは、有効成分の損失を防ぐために非吸着性ポリマーで作られています。","type":"general","meaning_category":"material property"},{"sentence":"Using a non-adsorbent filter ensures that the sample is not depleted of the target analyte.","translation":"非吸着性フィルターを使用することで、サンプルからターゲット分析対象物が枯渇しないようにします。","type":"technical","meaning_category":"application"}]}

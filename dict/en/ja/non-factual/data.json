It implies a deviation from reality or truth. It is often used in contexts where accuracy and truth are important, such as news reporting, historical accounts, or scientific research. It is stronger than \"inaccurate\" or \"incorrect\" because it suggests a more deliberate or significant departure from the truth.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The movie was a non-factual documentary.","correct":"✓ The movie was a fictionalized documentary. / ✓ The movie was a docudrama.","note":"Documentaries are generally expected to be factual.

It's used when talking about information, reports, or accounts that are not accurate or are made up. It's a more formal and specific way of saying something is false or untrue. You'll often see it used in discussions about journalism, history, or research where it's important to be accurate. It implies a stronger deviation from the truth than simply saying something is \"inaccurate.\" It's not a very common word in everyday conversation, but it's useful in formal writing and discussions where precision is important."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The politician was criticized for making non-factual claims during the debate.","translation":"その政治家は、討論中に事実に基づかない主張をしたとして批判された。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"事実に反する主張"},{"sentence":"The book presents a non-factual account of the war, relying more on myth than reality.","translation":"その本は、戦争の事実に基づかない説明をしており、現実よりも神話に頼っている。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"事実に基づかない説明"},{"sentence":"It is important to distinguish between factual reporting and non-factual entertainment.","translation":"事実に基づいた報道と、事実に基づかない娯楽を区別することが重要だ。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"事実に基づかない娯楽"},{"sentence":"The website was flagged for publishing non-factual information about health.","translation":"そのウェブサイトは、健康に関する事実に基づかない情報を公開したとして警告された。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"事実に基づかない情報"}]}

It refers to the act of dividing something into three equal parts. A famous problem in mathematics is the 'angle trisection' problem, which asks whether it is possible to divide any angle into three equal angles using only a compass and straightedge. It has been proven that this is not possible for all angles.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The trisection was done by two sections.","correct":"✓ The trisection was done by three sections.","note":"Trisection means dividing into three parts, not two."}],"priority":"★☆☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["trisect (verb: 三等分する)","trisector (noun: 三等分線)"],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency.","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Trisection' is a specialized term, primarily used in mathematics, specifically geometry.

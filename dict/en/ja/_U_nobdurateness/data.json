It describes a high degree of stubbornness or inflexibility. Understanding its etymology helps to grasp its meaning: the prefix 'un-' negates 'obdurate,' which means hardened or resistant. Therefore, 'unobdurateness' signifies a state of being extremely resistant to persuasion or change. Due to its formality and infrequent use, it's more often encountered in literature or formal writing than in everyday conversation."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The government's unobdurateness on the issue led to widespread protests.","translation":"政府のその問題に対する強情さが、広範囲にわたる抗議活動につながった。","type":"general","meaning_category":"強情さ"},{"sentence":"Her unobdurateness in sticking to her principles earned her both respect and criticism.","translation":"彼女が自分の主義を固守した強情さは、尊敬と批判の両方をもたらした。","type":"general","meaning_category":"不屈の精神"},{"sentence":"The company's unobdurateness in negotiations resulted in a failed merger.","translation":"会社の交渉における頑固さが、合併の失敗につながった。","type":"business","meaning_category":"頑固さ"}]}

It's used to describe something that has a degree of enthusiasm or enjoyment, but perhaps not to the fullest extent. Because it's not a standard word, it might not be appropriate for formal writing or conversation. It's more likely to be used in creative or descriptive contexts where the speaker or writer wants to convey a sense of something being somewhat enthusiastic or lively.

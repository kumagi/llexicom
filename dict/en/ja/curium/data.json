It is a transuranic element, meaning it has an atomic number greater than that of uranium (92). Curium is highly radioactive and must be handled with care. Its isotopes have some specialized uses, such as in radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs) for powering equipment in space.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"Curium is a very common element.","correct":"Curium is a rare, synthetic element.","note":"Curium is not common; it is synthetic and rare."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["curic (adjective, relating to curium)"],"related_elements":["americium","plutonium","uranium"]},"level_frequency":{"frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency.

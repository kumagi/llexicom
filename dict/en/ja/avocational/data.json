'Avocation' comes from the Latin 'avocationem,' meaning 'a calling away, distraction,' from 'avocare,' meaning 'to call away' (a- 'away' + vocare 'to call').","priority":"★★★"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/ˌævoʊˈkeɪʃənəl/","syllables":"a-vo-ca-tion-al"},"inflection":{"notes":"Adjective; comparative and superlative forms are 'more avocational' and 'most avocational,' respectively."},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Avocational' is used to describe activities or interests that are pursued for pleasure or personal fulfillment, rather than for professional or financial gain.

In this case, the sentence needs an article ('an') before 'avocational' because it modifies the noun 'doctor' in a descriptive sense (e.g., 'He is an avocational doctor, meaning he practices medicine as a hobby'). However, the sentence is more likely to be phrased as 'He practices medicine as an avocation.'"},{"incorrect":"✗ She has many vocation activities.","correct":"✓ She has many avocational activities.","note":"'Vocation' refers to a profession or career, while 'avocation' refers to a hobby or leisure activity.

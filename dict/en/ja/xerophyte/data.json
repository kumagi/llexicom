These plants often have specialized features like thick cuticles, reduced leaf surface area (or spines instead of leaves), deep root systems, and the ability to store water in their tissues (succulence). Common examples include cacti, succulents, and some grasses. The term can be used both as a noun to refer to the plant itself and as an adjective to describe characteristics or adaptations related to such plants.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The xerophyte is growing well in the pond.","correct":"✓ The xerophyte is growing well in the desert.","note":"Xerophytes thrive in dry environments, not in water-rich environments like ponds."},{"incorrect":"✗ Xerophytes don't need any water.","correct":"✓ Xerophytes need very little water.","note":"Xerophytes are adapted to survive with limited water, but they still require some water to live."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["xerophytic (adjective: 乾燥植物の、乾生植物の)","xerophytically (adverb: 乾燥植物的に)","xeromorphy (noun: 乾燥形態)"],"phrasal_verbs":[],"priority":"★☆☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"低頻度 (Low frequency) - 専門的な植物学の用語。","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"The word \"xerophyte\" is a technical term used in botany to describe plants that are adapted to survive in dry environments.

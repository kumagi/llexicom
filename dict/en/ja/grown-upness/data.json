It is formed by adding the suffix '-ness' to the term 'grown-up'. The word is more abstract and less frequently used than synonyms like 'maturity' or 'adulthood'. Its usage often implies a specific focus on the characteristics and behaviors associated with being an adult, rather than simply the state of being grown. Because of its relative infrequency and the abstract nature of the concept, it is more likely to be encountered in advanced texts or discussions.

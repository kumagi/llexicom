It refers to a specific type of patch file format that is designed to be more efficient than traditional diff formats. The key advantage of Tarepatch is its ability to detect similarities between files even when they have been moved or renamed, resulting in smaller patch files. This makes it particularly useful for distributing updates to large software packages or games where bandwidth is a concern. Understanding Tarepatch requires familiarity with software development concepts such as delta encoding and patching algorithms."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The developers used a **Tarepatch** to update the game, reducing the download size significantly.","translation":"開発者はゲームをアップデートするために**Tarepatch**を使用し、ダウンロードサイズを大幅に削減しました。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"Software Update"},{"sentence":"Creating a **Tarepatch** requires specialized tools that can identify similarities across file structures.","translation":"**Tarepatch**を作成するには、ファイル構造全体の類似性を識別できる特殊なツールが必要です。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"Software Development"}]}

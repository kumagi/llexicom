Microsatellites are characterized by being highly variable in length, even within a single species, which makes them valuable markers for genetic mapping, population genetics, and forensics.","examples":[{"sentence":"Microsatellite markers are used to study genetic diversity in populations.","translation":"マイクロサテライトマーカーは、集団における遺伝的多様性を研究するために使用されます。"},{"sentence":"The length of the microsatellite repeat can be used to identify individuals.","translation":"マイクロサテライトリピートの長さは、個体を識別するために使用できます。"},{"sentence":"Microsatellite instability is a hallmark of some cancers.","translation":"マイクロサテライト不安定性は、一部の癌の特徴です。"}],"collocations":["microsatellite marker","microsatellite instability","microsatellite analysis","microsatellite DNA","microsatellite locus"],"synonyms":["short tandem repeat (STR)","simple sequence repeat (SSR)"],"antonyms":[]}],"etymology":{"value":"The term 'microsatellite' reflects the small size and repetitive nature of these DNA sequences.

This makes them useful for genetic fingerprinting and studying evolutionary relationships. Microsatellite instability (MSI) is a condition where the number of repeats in a microsatellite changes, often due to defects in DNA mismatch repair genes. MSI is associated with certain types of cancer.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Microsatellites are used for protein analysis.","correct":"✓ Microsatellites are used for DNA analysis.","note":"Microsatellites are DNA sequences, not proteins."},{"incorrect":"✗ Microsatellites are very stable sequences.","correct":"✓ Microsatellites are highly variable sequences.","note":"Microsatellites are known for their high variability."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["microsatellite instability (MSI)"],"phrasal_verbs":[],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low","priority":"★★☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Microsatellite' refers to a specific type of DNA sequence characterized by short, repeating units.

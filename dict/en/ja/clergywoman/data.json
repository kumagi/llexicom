It is a compound word, formed by combining 'clergy' (referring to the body of all people ordained for religious duties) and 'woman' (referring to a female person). This term is used in religious contexts to specifically identify a female individual who holds a position of religious leadership, such as a priest, pastor, or minister. Its usage is more common in denominations that allow women to serve in these roles, and it helps to distinguish from 'clergyman,' which refers to a male member of the clergy. The term is generally straightforward in meaning but is most relevant and understood within religious or sociological discussions about gender roles in religious institutions."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The **clergywoman** led the congregation in prayer.","translation":"その女性聖職者は会衆を導き祈りを捧げた。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"女性聖職者"},{"sentence":"Our new pastor is a **clergywoman**.","translation":"私たちの新しい牧師は女性聖職者です。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"女性聖職者"}]}

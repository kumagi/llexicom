Al-Khwarizmi wrote influential books on mathematics, including one on algebra and another on Hindu-Arabic numerals. The term 'algorithm' originally referred to the rules for performing arithmetic using Hindu-Arabic numerals, but its meaning has since broadened to encompass any well-defined computational procedure.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/ˌælɡəˈrɪzmɪk/","syllables":"al-go-rith-mic"},"inflection":{"notes":"Since 'algorismic' is an adjective, its inflection is limited.

It is often used in technical contexts, such as computer science, mathematics, and finance, to describe processes, methods, or systems that follow a specific set of rules or instructions. While 'algorithmic' is a more common synonym, 'algorismic' can be used to emphasize the procedural and deterministic nature of something.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The algorismic is very complex.","correct":"✓ The algorithm is very complex.","note":"'Algorismic' is an adjective, so it should be used to describe a noun, not as a noun itself.

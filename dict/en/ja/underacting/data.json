It describes a style where the actor deliberately restrains their performance, often to the point where it lacks energy or emotion. This can be a deliberate choice for stylistic reasons, but it can also be seen as a flaw if the performance becomes too flat or unengaging. It's the opposite of 'overacting,' where the actor exaggerates their performance.

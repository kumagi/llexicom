It is less severe than protanopia, where red cones are completely absent. People with protanomaly have red cones, but they are abnormal, causing a reduced sensitivity to red light. This makes it harder to distinguish between certain shades of red, orange, yellow, and green. Diagnosis is typically made through color vision tests such as the Ishihara test or specialized color arrangement tests.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Protanomaly is the same as protanopia.","correct":"✓ Protanomaly is a milder form of red-green color blindness than protanopia.","note":"Protanomaly involves a reduced sensitivity to red, while protanopia involves a complete absence of red cones.

It works based on Archimedes' principle, where a solid body floats higher in a denser liquid. The hydrometer is typically made of glass and consists of a cylindrical stem and a weighted bulb to make it float upright. A scale on the stem allows direct reading of the specific gravity.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ I used a barometer to measure the density of the liquid.","correct":"✓ I used a hydrometer to measure the density of the liquid.","note":"A barometer measures atmospheric pressure, while a hydrometer measures the density of liquids."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["hydrometry (noun: the science or practice of measuring the specific gravity of liquids)"],"phrasal_verbs":[],"related_terms":["density","specific gravity","Archimedes' principle"]},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"B2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"A hydrometer is a scientific instrument used to measure the density of liquids. It works by floating in the liquid; the depth to which it sinks indicates the liquid's density. This tool is commonly used in industries like brewing, winemaking, and battery maintenance to ensure the correct concentration of solutions. Understanding its function requires some knowledge of physics, specifically Archimedes' principle."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The winemaker used a **hydrometer** to ensure the grape juice had the correct sugar concentration for fermentation.","translation":"ワイン醸造家は、ブドウジュースが発酵に適した糖度を持っているか確認するために比重計を使った。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"比重測定"},{"sentence":"By using a **hydrometer**, the mechanic could quickly assess the condition of the battery acid.","translation":"整備士は比重計を使うことで、バッテリー液の状態を迅速に評価できた。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"比重測定"}]}

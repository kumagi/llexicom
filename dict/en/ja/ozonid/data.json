They are formed by the reaction of ozone with unsaturated organic compounds, such as alkenes. Ozonides are generally unstable and prone to explosive decomposition, especially when in concentrated form. They are important intermediates in ozonolysis reactions, which are used in organic synthesis to cleave carbon-carbon double bonds.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[],"priority":"☆☆☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["ozonolysis","ozone"],"phrasal_verbs":[]},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Very low frequency","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"The term 'ozonid' refers to a specific type of chemical compound formed through the reaction of ozone with unsaturated compounds. Understanding this term requires a background in organic chemistry, particularly knowledge of ozone reactions and functional groups. The instability and potential explosiveness of ozonides make them relevant in specialized chemical contexts. Due to its technical nature, this term is rarely encountered outside of scientific literature or discussions.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The reaction produced a mixture of aldehydes and an ozonide.","translation":"その反応により、アルデヒドとオゾン化合物の混合物が生成されました。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"オゾン化化合物"},{"sentence":"Ozonides are key intermediates in the ozonolysis of alkenes.","translation":"オゾン化物は、アルケンのオゾン分解における重要な中間体です。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"オゾン化化合物"}]}

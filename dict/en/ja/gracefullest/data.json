It is used to describe something or someone that possesses an exceptional level of beauty, poise, or refinement in their movements, appearance, or style. While grammatically correct, it's less commonly used than phrases like 'most graceful' or 'extremely graceful,' especially in modern English. It tends to appear more often in literary or formal contexts.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ She is gracefullest than her sister.","correct":"✓ She is more graceful than her sister.","note":"When comparing two things, use the comparative form ('more graceful') rather than the superlative ('gracefullest')."},{"incorrect":"✗ This is a very gracefullest dance.","correct":"✓ This is a very graceful dance. / ✓ This is the gracefullest dance.","note":"'Gracefullest' is already a superlative, so it doesn't need 'very' before it.

It describes the action of making something shorter, usually while keeping the important parts. It can refer to physical shortening (like cutting a text) or abstract reduction (like limiting rights). The gerund form acts as a noun (e.g., 'Abridging can be useful'), while the present participle form acts as part of a continuous verb tense (e.g., 'They are abridging the report') or as an adjective (e.g., 'the abridging process').","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ He is abridging the rights of the people.","correct":"✓ He is infringing on the rights of the people. / ✓ He is abridging the scope of the rights.","note":"While 'abridging rights' is technically correct, it can sound awkward.

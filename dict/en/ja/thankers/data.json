It is often used in formal contexts, such as when an organization is acknowledging its supporters. Because it is not frequently used, it is more likely to be encountered in written materials or formal speeches rather than everyday conversation. It's important to remember that it's a plural noun, so it always takes a plural verb. Also, it is not a direct expression of gratitude like 'thank you'; rather, it refers to the people who are giving thanks."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"Our organization relies on the generosity of our thankers to continue our work.","translation":"私たちの組織は、活動を継続するために、感謝者の皆様の寛大さに頼っています。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"感謝する人々"},{"sentence":"The annual report listed all the major thankers who contributed to the campaign.","translation":"年次報告書には、キャンペーンに貢献した主要な感謝者全員が記載されていました。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"感謝者たち"}]}

It's a compound adjective, meaning it's formed from multiple words joined together. The word 'compliant' means 'willing to obey', so 'non-compliant' means 'not willing to obey'. Adding '-looking' indicates that this unwillingness is based on appearance. This term is not very common and might be used in more formal or specific contexts, such as security or law enforcement. The reader should understand the meaning of 'compliant' and how prefixes like 'non-' change the meaning of words.","priority":"★★★"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The security guard eyed the non-compliant-looking teenager suspiciously.","translation":"警備員は、従順でないように見えるティーンエイジャーを疑わしげに見た。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"appearance"},{"sentence":"The dog, with its ears back and teeth bared, had a decidedly non-compliant-looking demeanor.","translation":"耳を後ろに倒し、歯をむき出しにしたその犬は、明らかに非協力的な態度だった。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"appearance"},{"sentence":"The software flagged the transaction as suspicious due to the non-compliant-looking data entry.","translation":"そのソフトウェアは、従順でないように見えるデータ入力のために、その取引を疑わしいものとしてフラグを立てた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"appearance"}]}

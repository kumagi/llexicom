It is used to create extremely thin slices of samples, often at the nanometer scale, which are then examined using electron microscopes. This level of detail allows researchers to study the ultrastructure of cells and materials. The term is primarily encountered in academic and research contexts. Understanding its function requires familiarity with microscopy techniques and sample preparation methods."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The researcher carefully adjusted the settings on the ultramicrotome before beginning the sectioning process.","translation":"研究者は切片作成プロセスを開始する前に、超ミクロトームの設定を注意深く調整しました。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"装置"},{"sentence":"Using the ultramicrotome, we were able to obtain sections thin enough for high-resolution electron microscopy.","translation":"超ミクロトームを使用することで、高解像度電子顕微鏡に十分な薄さの切片を得ることができました。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"装置"}]}

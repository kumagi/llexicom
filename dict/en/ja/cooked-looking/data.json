It's a figurative expression, implying that the person's skin resembles something that has been overcooked. This term is not commonly used in formal contexts and may be considered somewhat informal or colloquial. It's important to note that it's generally used to describe people, not objects or food items (for which \"overcooked\" would be more appropriate)."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"After spending the afternoon gardening in the sun, her face had a cooked-looking appearance.","translation":"太陽の下で午後を庭仕事に費やした後、彼女の顔は日焼けしたように見えた。","type":"descriptive","meaning_category":"Appearance"},{"sentence":"He warned his friend about staying out in the sun too long, saying he didn't want him to get that cooked-looking complexion.","translation":"彼は友人に日差しの中に長くいないように警告し、日焼けしたように見えてほしくないと言った。","type":"warning","meaning_category":"Health"}]}

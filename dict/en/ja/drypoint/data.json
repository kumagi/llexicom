The key characteristic of drypoint is the burr – a ridge of metal thrown up on either side of the scratched line. This burr holds ink, creating a soft, velvety line in the print. Because the burr is fragile, drypoint plates wear quickly, resulting in a limited number of high-quality prints.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ I did a drypoint on wood.","correct":"✓ I did a drypoint on a metal plate.","note":"Drypoint is typically done on metal plates, such as copper or zinc, not wood."},{"incorrect":"✗ Drypoint uses acid to etch the plate.","correct":"✓ Drypoint does not use acid to etch the plate.","note":"Drypoint is a 'dry' process, meaning it doesn't use acid, unlike etching."}],"priority":"★☆☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["drypoint (adjective)"],"phrasal_verbs":[],"related_terms":["intaglio","etching","engraving","burr","printmaking","print","plate","needle"]},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Drypoint' refers to a specialized printmaking technique.

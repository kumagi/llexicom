While grammatically correct, it is less commonly used than 'beneficiary'. 'Beneficiary' is typically used in more formal or legal contexts. 'Benefiter' is understandable but may sound slightly awkward or less natural to native English speakers. In many cases, rephrasing the sentence to use the verb 'benefit' might be preferable. For example, instead of 'She is a benefiter of the program,' you could say 'She benefits from the program.'"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The students are the main benefiters of the new scholarship program.","translation":"学生たちは、新しい奨学金プログラムの主な恩恵を受ける人々です。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"恩恵を受ける人"},{"sentence":"As a benefiter of the company's success, he received a substantial bonus.","translation":"会社の成功の恩恵を受ける人として、彼はかなりのボーナスを受け取りました。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"利益を得る人"}]}

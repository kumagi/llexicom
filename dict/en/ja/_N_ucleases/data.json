They are crucial for various cellular processes, including DNA replication, DNA repair, and RNA processing. Nucleases are broadly classified into endonucleases and exonucleases. Endonucleases cleave phosphodiester bonds within a nucleic acid chain, while exonucleases remove nucleotides from the ends of the chain. Restriction enzymes are a type of endonuclease widely used in molecular biology.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Nuclease are important.","correct":"✓ Nucleases are important.","note":"'Nucleases' is a plural noun, so it requires a plural verb form."}],"priority":"★☆☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["nuclease (singular form)","endonuclease","exonuclease","ribonuclease","deoxyribonuclease"],"phrasal_verbs":[]},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Nucleases' refers to a group of enzymes that are very important in biology. They work by cutting DNA or RNA molecules. Think of them like molecular scissors. They are used by cells for things like fixing damaged DNA or controlling how genes are expressed. Scientists also use them as tools in the lab, for example, to cut DNA in specific places when they are doing genetic engineering."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The activity of nucleases can be regulated by various cellular factors.","translation":"ヌクレアーゼの活性は、さまざまな細胞因子によって調節されうる。","type":"general","meaning_category":"Function"},{"sentence":"Specific nucleases target and degrade mRNA molecules.","translation":"特定のヌクレアーゼはmRNA分子を標的とし、分解する。","type":"specific","meaning_category":"Targeting"},{"sentence":"Defects in nuclease activity can lead to genomic instability.","translation":"ヌクレアーゼ活性の欠陥は、ゲノムの不安定性につながる可能性がある。","type":"medical","meaning_category":"Implications"}]}

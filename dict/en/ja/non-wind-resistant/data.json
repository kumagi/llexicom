It is the opposite of 'wind-resistant' or 'windproof'. You would use this term when describing materials or items that allow wind to pass through them easily. For example, a thin cotton shirt would be considered non-wind-resistant. This is a technical term, so it is not commonly used in everyday conversation, but it is useful in contexts where the wind resistance of a material is important."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The umbrella's material was non-wind-resistant, and it quickly turned inside out in the strong breeze.","translation":"その傘の素材は防風性がなく、強い風ですぐに裏返ってしまった。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"防風性がない"},{"sentence":"For summer hiking, choose clothing that is lightweight and non-wind-resistant to stay cool.","translation":"夏のハイキングには、涼しく過ごせるように、軽量で防風性のない服を選びましょう。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"防風性がない"}]}

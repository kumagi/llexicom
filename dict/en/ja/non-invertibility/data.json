It describes a situation where a transformation or operation cannot be uniquely reversed. For example, a matrix is non-invertible (or singular) if its determinant is zero, meaning there's no matrix that, when multiplied by the original matrix, results in the identity matrix. Similarly, a function is non-invertible if it's not one-to-one (injective), meaning multiple inputs can produce the same output, making it impossible to determine the original input from the output alone.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The invertibility is not present.","correct":"✓ Non-invertibility is present. / ✓ It lacks invertibility.","note":"Using 'invertibility is not present' is grammatically correct but less precise than stating 'non-invertibility is present' or 'it lacks invertibility', which directly conveys the concept."},{"incorrect":"✗ The function is not invertible, so it has invertibility.","correct":"✓ The function is not invertible, so it has non-invertibility.","note":"This example demonstrates a misunderstanding of the core concept.

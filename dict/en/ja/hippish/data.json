It suggests a connection to the hippie lifestyle, which often involved things like long hair, colorful clothes, a love of nature, and a desire for peace and freedom. However, \"hippish\" implies a less intense or committed connection than being a full \"hippie.\" It's like saying something has a 'hippie vibe' without being completely dedicated to the lifestyle. The word is not very common, so it's more likely to be understood by people familiar with the hippie culture.","priority":"★☆☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The restaurant had a **hippish** atmosphere with its tie-dye tablecloths and psychedelic art.","translation":"そのレストランは、タイダイのテーブルクロスとサイケデリックなアートでヒッピー風の雰囲気だった。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"ヒッピー風の雰囲気"},{"sentence":"Her clothes were a bit **hippish**, but she still looked professional.","translation":"彼女の服は少しヒッピー風だったが、それでもプロフェッショナルに見えた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"ややヒッピー的な傾向がある"},{"sentence":"The music festival had a **hippish** vibe, with lots of people wearing flowers in their hair.","translation":"その音楽祭は、たくさんの人が髪に花を飾っていて、ヒッピー風の雰囲気だった。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"ヒッピー風の雰囲気"},{"sentence":"He adopted a **hippish** lifestyle after traveling through Southeast Asia.","translation":"彼は東南アジアを旅行した後、ヒッピー風のライフスタイルを取り入れた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"ヒッピー風のライフスタイル"}]}

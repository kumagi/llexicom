The word \"untasselled\" is most likely to be encountered in descriptive writing where the author is emphasizing the absence of such ornamentation. Because it is a niche word, its use is limited to contexts where the presence or absence of tassels is relevant. It can also be used figuratively to describe something lacking in embellishment or ornamentation."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The graduation gown was simple and untasselled.","translation":"卒業ガウンはシンプルでタッセルが付いていなかった。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"タッセルがない"},{"sentence":"The speaker delivered an untasselled speech, focusing solely on the facts.","translation":"講演者は飾り気のないスピーチを行い、事実のみに焦点を当てた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"飾り気がない"}]}

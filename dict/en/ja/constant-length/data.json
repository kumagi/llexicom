It's often used in computer science or data management contexts. For example, if you have a 'constant-length' field in a database, it means that each entry in that field will always take up the same amount of space, regardless of the actual data stored there. This can make things easier to process, but it might also waste space if some entries are much shorter than the maximum allowed length."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"Using constant-length strings simplifies memory allocation.","translation":"固定長の文字列を使用すると、メモリ割り当てが簡素化されます。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"fixed length"},{"sentence":"The protocol uses constant-length headers for efficient parsing.","translation":"プロトコルは、効率的な解析のために固定長のヘッダーを使用します。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"fixed length"}]}

They typically consist of a characteristic sequence of rock types, including deep-sea sediments, pillow basalts, sheeted dikes, gabbros, and ultramafic rocks (such as peridotite and serpentinite) from the upper mantle. The study of ophiolites helps geologists understand the processes of seafloor spreading, plate tectonics, and mountain building.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The ophiolite is made of granite.","correct":"✓ The ophiolite contains gabbro and serpentinite.","note":"Ophiolites are composed of rocks associated with oceanic crust, such as gabbro, basalt, and serpentinite, not granite (which is associated with continental crust)."},{"incorrect":"✗ Ophiolites are only found in the ocean.","correct":"✓ Ophiolites are found on land, but they originated in the ocean.","note":"Ophiolites are fragments of oceanic crust that have been uplifted onto land through tectonic processes."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["ophiolitic (adjective)"],"phrasal_verbs":[],"priority":"★☆☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Very low frequency","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"An 'ophiolite' is a technical term in geology referring to a specific section of the Earth's oceanic crust that has been moved onto a continental margin.

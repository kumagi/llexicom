It refers to the ease and effectiveness with which a system, process, or activity can be observed and tracked. High monitorability is generally desirable, as it allows for early detection of problems and facilitates proactive management. It is closely related to 'observability,' but 'monitorability' often implies a more active and intentional process of tracking and assessment.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The monitorability is important.","correct":"✓ High monitorability is important. / ✓ The monitorability of the system is important.","note":"'Monitorability' is a quality, so it's better to specify what has that quality or to use an adjective like 'high' or 'low' to describe the degree of monitorability."},{"incorrect":"✗ We need to monitorize the system for better monitorability.","correct":"✓ We need to monitor the system to improve its monitorability.","note":"'Monitorize' is a less common and often unnecessary verb form.

It describes how easily and effectively you can watch and track a system or process. If something has high 'monitorability,' it means you can easily see what's happening inside it by looking at its outputs. This is important for finding problems quickly and managing things well. It's similar to 'observability,' but 'monitorability' often means you're actively watching and checking things, not just passively observing."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The improved **monitorability** allowed for faster identification of bottlenecks in the network.","translation":"監視可能性が向上したことで、ネットワークのボトルネックをより迅速に特定できるようになりました。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"監視可能性"},{"sentence":"Without adequate **monitorability**, it is difficult to ensure the reliability of the system.","translation":"適切な監視可能性がなければ、システムの信頼性を確保することは困難です。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"監視可能性"},{"sentence":"The team focused on enhancing the **monitorability** of the application to proactively address potential issues.","translation":"チームは、潜在的な問題を事前に解決するために、アプリケーションの監視可能性の向上に注力しました。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"監視可能性"}]}

Unlike true osteomalacia, which is primarily due to vitamin D deficiency, pseudo-osteomalacia arises from other factors that disrupt bone mineralization, such as renal tubular acidosis, hypophosphatemia (low phosphate levels in the blood), or certain medications. Diagnosis typically involves blood tests, urine tests, and bone biopsies to differentiate it from true osteomalacia. Treatment focuses on addressing the underlying cause to restore proper bone mineralization.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The patient has osteomalacia, so it must be a vitamin D deficiency.","correct":"✓ The patient has bone softening, but further testing is needed to rule out pseudo-osteomalacia.","note":"It's crucial to differentiate between osteomalacia and pseudo-osteomalacia through proper diagnostic testing, as the causes and treatments differ."}],"priority":"★☆☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["pseudo- (prefix meaning false or deceptive)","osteomalacia (softening of the bones)","hypophosphatemia (low phosphate levels in the blood)","renal tubular acidosis (a kidney disorder)"],"phrasal_verbs":[],"priority":"★☆☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Pseudo-osteomalacia' is a medical term referring to a condition that resembles osteomalacia but has different causes. It's important to understand that this condition is not due to vitamin D deficiency, which is the primary cause of osteomalacia. Instead, pseudo-osteomalacia is often linked to kidney problems or low phosphate levels in the blood. The diagnosis and treatment approaches for pseudo-osteomalacia differ from those for osteomalacia, so accurate identification is essential."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The patient was diagnosed with pseudo-osteomalacia due to renal tubular acidosis.","translation":"その患者は腎尿細管アシドーシスによる偽骨軟化症と診断されました。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"medical condition"},{"sentence":"Unlike osteomalacia, pseudo-osteomalacia is not primarily caused by vitamin D deficiency.","translation":"骨軟化症とは異なり、偽骨軟化症は主にビタミンD欠乏症によって引き起こされるものではありません。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"medical condition"}]}

They are produced by a wide variety of body cells, but especially by leukocytes (white blood cells). Interleukins can affect the behavior of other cells, including other immune cells, and are thus important in the body's defense mechanisms. Different interleukins have different functions, and they are often numbered (e.g., IL-1, IL-2, IL-6) to distinguish them. Research into interleukins has led to the development of new therapies for autoimmune diseases, cancer, and other conditions.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Interleukin are important for immune system.","correct":"✓ Interleukins are important for the immune system.","note":"Interleukin is a countable noun, so it needs to be pluralized when referring to the group of molecules in general.

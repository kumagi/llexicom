It is often used in contexts where the scale or extent of something is difficult to comprehend, such as the universe or a large desert. Because it is not a commonly used word, it is more likely to be found in formal writing or scientific contexts. The word is formed by adding the prefix \"super-\" to \"vastness,\" which already means \"great size or extent.\" Therefore, \"supervastness\" implies an even greater degree of vastness.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The sheer supervastness of the data set posed a significant challenge to the researchers.","translation":"そのデータセットの途方もない広大さが、研究者にとって大きな課題となった。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"広大さ"},{"sentence":"Looking out at the star-filled sky, she was struck by the supervastness of space.","translation":"星空を見上げ、彼女は宇宙の極度の広大さに心を打たれた。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"広がり"}]}

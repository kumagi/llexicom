The term is used in various contexts, including statistics, physics, and everyday language. In statistics, it refers to the number of times a particular value occurs in a dataset. In physics, especially in the context of waves (e.g., sound waves, electromagnetic waves), it refers to the number of cycles per unit of time, typically measured in Hertz (Hz). In general usage, it can simply refer to how often something happens.

It's often used in science and technology to talk about things like radio waves or sound waves. For example, different radio stations use different 'frequencies' to broadcast their signals. It can also be used more generally to talk about how often events happen, like 'the frequencies of earthquakes in this region have increased'.

It means to quickly look over something before reading it more closely. Since it's not a common word, it's best used when you want to specifically emphasize that you're doing a quick, initial read to get a general idea before a more thorough study. It is more common to use 'skim', 'scan', or 'browse' instead. Due to its specialized nature, it's more likely to be encountered in academic or professional contexts, and even then, it might be considered somewhat jargonistic.","priority":"★☆☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"She decided to **preperuse** the report before attending the meeting.","translation":"彼女は会議に出席する前に報告書をざっと目を通すことにした。","type":"verb (vt)","meaning_category":"ざっと目を通す"},{"sentence":"I like to **preperuse** the menu before ordering at a new restaurant.","translation":"新しいレストランで注文する前にメニューをざっと見るのが好きだ。","type":"verb (vt)","meaning_category":"ざっと目を通す"},{"sentence":"The student **preperused** the assigned reading to get a sense of the main arguments.","translation":"学生は、割り当てられた読書資料を予習して、主な論点を把握した。","type":"verb (vt)","meaning_category":"予習する"}]}

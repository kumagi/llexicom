These walls are often lignified, meaning they contain lignin, a complex polymer that makes them strong and resistant to decay. Sclerenchyma provides structural support and mechanical strength to plants, allowing them to withstand various stresses such as wind, gravity, and herbivore damage. There are two main types of sclerenchyma cells: fibers, which are long and slender, and sclereids, which are shorter and more irregular in shape.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Sclerenchyma is a type of parenchyma.","correct":"✓ Sclerenchyma is a type of support tissue.","note":"Sclerenchyma is a support tissue, while parenchyma is a type of ground tissue."},{"incorrect":"✗ Sclerenchyma cells have thin walls.","correct":"✓ Sclerenchyma cells have thick walls.","note":"Sclerenchyma cells are characterized by their thick, lignified walls."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["sclerenchymatous (adjective)"],"phrasal_verbs":[],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Sclerenchyma' is a technical term used in botany to describe a type of plant tissue that provides structural support.

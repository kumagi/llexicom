It is a crucial property in various fields, including engineering, chemistry, and fire safety. High ignitibility indicates that a substance can be easily ignited with a small amount of energy, while low ignitibility means it requires more energy to ignite.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The ignitability of the wood is very ignite.","correct":"✓ The ignitibility of the wood is very high.","note":"'Ignite' is a verb, while 'ignitibility' is a noun.

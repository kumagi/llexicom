It combines elements of telemetry (remote data transmission), hydrology (the study of water), and barometry (the measurement of atmospheric pressure). This device is particularly useful in scenarios where direct access to a measurement site is challenging or impossible, such as in flood monitoring or remote weather stations. The data collected is transmitted wirelessly to a central location for analysis and decision-making. Understanding this term requires familiarity with scientific and technical vocabulary."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The **telehydrobarometer** provided crucial data during the flood.","translation":"その遠隔水位気圧計は、洪水時に重要なデータを提供した。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"measurement"},{"sentence":"Researchers are deploying a new network of **telehydrobarometers** across the watershed.","translation":"研究者たちは、流域全体に新しい遠隔水位気圧計のネットワークを展開している。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"monitoring"}]}

'Brood' comes from Old English 'brōd', meaning 'offspring, a breeding'.

It is most often encountered in specialized contexts, such as ornithology (the study of birds) or in more literary or academic writing. The figurative use requires an understanding of the connotations of 'brooding' as deep thought or worry, and the negation of that state with 'un-'. Because of its limited usage and conceptual complexity, it is not suitable for beginner or intermediate learners."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The scientist examined the unbrooded reptile eggs in the incubator.","translation":"科学者はインキュベーターの中の抱卵されていない爬虫類の卵を調べた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"Not incubated"},{"sentence":"The professor presented an unbrooded theory, inviting critique and refinement from his colleagues.","translation":"教授は、同僚からの批判と改善を求め、十分に検討されていない理論を発表した。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"Not considered"}]}

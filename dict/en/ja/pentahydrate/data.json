Hydrates are compounds that have water molecules chemically bonded within their crystal structure. The prefix 'penta-' indicates that there are exactly five water molecules associated with each molecule of the compound. This term is typically encountered in scientific or technical contexts, such as chemistry textbooks, research papers, or laboratory settings.

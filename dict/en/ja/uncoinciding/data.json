It is often used in formal or academic contexts to describe events, opinions, or data points that do not align or overlap. Because it is not a frequently used word, it is important to ensure that the context clearly indicates its meaning to avoid confusion. It is often used in contrast to \"coinciding,\" which means occurring at the same time or being in agreement."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The uncoinciding timelines of the projects made collaboration difficult.","translation":"プロジェクトのタイムラインが一致しなかったため、共同作業が困難になった。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"一致しない"},{"sentence":"The uncoinciding survey results suggested a lack of consensus among the respondents.","translation":"調査結果が一致しなかったため、回答者間にコンセンサスがないことが示唆された。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"調和しない"}]}

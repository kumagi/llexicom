'Melodrama' combines 'melody' (from Greek 'melos,' meaning song or tune) and 'drama.' Initially, it referred to dramatic works with musical accompaniment. Over time, it evolved to describe sensational dramatic pieces with exaggerated emotions and stereotypical characters. The suffix '-ise' (or '-ize' in American English) is added to form the verb, indicating the act of making something melodramatic.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/ˌmeləˈdrɑːmətaɪzɪŋ/","syllables":"me-lo-dra-ma-tis-ing"},"inflection":{"verb_forms":{"present_simple":["melodramatise","melodramatises"],"past_simple":"melodramatised","past_participle":"melodramatised","present_participle":"melodramatising"}},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Melodramatising' implies an excessive or theatrical way of presenting a situation or one's emotions.

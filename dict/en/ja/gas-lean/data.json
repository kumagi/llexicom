It describes a fuel mixture where there is a relatively low amount of fuel compared to the amount of air. This is the opposite of a 'gas-rich' or 'fuel-rich' mixture. Understanding this term requires some knowledge of engine mechanics and combustion principles. It's not a commonly used term outside of technical contexts.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The mechanic adjusted the carburetor to prevent the engine from running **gas-lean**.","translation":"整備士は、エンジンが燃料希薄な状態で運転しないようにキャブレターを調整した。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"fuel mixture"},{"sentence":"A **gas-lean** air-fuel ratio can lead to increased nitrogen oxide emissions.","translation":"燃料が希薄な空燃比は、窒素酸化物の排出量増加につながる可能性がある。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"fuel mixture"}]}

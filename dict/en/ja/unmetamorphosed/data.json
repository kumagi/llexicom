'Metamorphosed' comes from 'metamorphosis', which originates from Greek 'metamorphosis' (μεταμόρφωσις), meaning 'transformation, changing of shape', from 'metamorphoun' (μεταμορφοῦν) 'to transform', from 'meta-' 'change' + 'morphe' 'form'.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/ˌʌnˌmɛtəˈmɔːrfəʊst/","syllables":"un-met-a-mor-phosed"},"inflection":{"notes":"This is an adjective, so it doesn't inflect like a verb.

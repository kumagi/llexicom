Examples include /f/, /v/, /s/, /z/, /θ/ (as in 'thin'), and /ð/ (as in 'this'). These sounds can be voiced (vibrating the vocal cords, like /v/ and /z/) or voiceless (without vocal cord vibration, like /f/ and /s/). The place of articulation (where the constriction occurs) also varies, resulting in different types of fricatives (e.g., labiodental, dental, alveolar).","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Fricatives are vowels.","correct":"✓ Fricatives are consonants.","note":"Fricatives are a type of consonant, not a vowel."},{"incorrect":"✗ All fricatives are voiced.","correct":"✓ Some fricatives are voiced, and some are voiceless.","note":"Fricatives can be either voiced or voiceless."},{"incorrect":"✗ Fricatives are easy to pronounce for all language learners.","correct":"✓ Fricatives can be difficult to pronounce for some language learners, depending on their native language.","note":"The difficulty of pronouncing fricatives varies depending on the learner's first language."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["fricative (adjective, noun)","frication (noun)"],"related_terms":["phonetics","phonology","consonant","vowel","articulation","place of articulation","manner of articulation","voice","voiceless","voiced"],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C1","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"The term 'fricatives' is a technical term used in phonetics and phonology, the study of speech sounds.

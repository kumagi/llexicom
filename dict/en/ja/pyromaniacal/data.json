Because it relates to a specific psychological condition, it is typically found in more formal or technical contexts, such as discussions of mental health, criminology, or forensic psychology. The word is built from the root word \"pyro-\" (fire), \"mania\" (madness), and the adjectival suffix \"-acal,\" so understanding these components can help in deciphering its meaning.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The detective suspected the suspect had pyromaniacal tendencies.","translation":"刑事はその容疑者が放火癖の傾向があると疑った。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"放火癖のある"},{"sentence":"The psychiatrist evaluated the patient for pyromaniacal behavior.","translation":"精神科医はその患者の放火癖の行動について評価した。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"放火狂の"},{"sentence":"The pyromaniacal arsonist caused significant damage to the building.","translation":"その放火狂の放火犯は建物に重大な損害を与えた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"放火狂の"}]}

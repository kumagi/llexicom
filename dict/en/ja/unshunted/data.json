It is formed by adding the prefix 'un-' to 'shunted,' meaning 'not shunted.' 'Shunted' itself means 'diverted' or 'redirected,' often in the context of trains being moved from one track to another. Therefore, 'unshunted' means 'not diverted' or 'not redirected.' Due to its rarity and specific meaning, it is most likely to be encountered in specialized contexts, such as discussions of transportation or focused attention."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The unshunted cargo train proceeded directly to its destination.","translation":"転換されなかった貨物列車は目的地に直行した。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"Not diverted (literal)"},{"sentence":"Her unshunted focus on the task at hand allowed her to finish it quickly.","translation":"彼女の目の前の仕事へのそらされなかった集中力のおかげで、彼女はそれを素早く終えることができた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"Not diverted (figurative)"}]}

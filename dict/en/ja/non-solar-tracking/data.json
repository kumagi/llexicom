It describes systems that do not automatically adjust their position to follow the sun's path. These systems are simpler and less expensive than solar-tracking systems, but they also tend to be less efficient. The term is most often encountered in engineering, scientific, and technical documentation related to solar power."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The cost of non-solar-tracking systems is significantly lower, making them accessible to a wider range of consumers.","translation":"非太陽追尾型システムのコストは大幅に低く、より幅広い消費者が利用できるようになっています。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"Describing a system"},{"sentence":"For residential applications, fixed non-solar-tracking panels are often preferred due to their ease of installation and maintenance.","translation":"住宅用途では、設置とメンテナンスが容易なため、固定式非太陽追尾型パネルが好まれることがよくあります。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"Describing a panel"}]}

It's a term primarily used in science, especially chemistry and physics. Think of it like adding too much sugar to iced tea – eventually, the sugar won't dissolve, and you'll see it settling at the bottom. Supersaturation is a similar concept, but in this case, the substance remains dissolved, creating an unstable condition. This term can also be used more broadly to describe an excess of something, like information or media content."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The cloud chamber creates a supersaturation of alcohol vapor.","translation":"霧箱はアルコール蒸気の過飽和状態を作り出す。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"科学"},{"sentence":"The market is experiencing a supersaturation of similar products.","translation":"市場は類似製品の過飽和状態を経験している。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"一般"}]}

Literally, it refers to the absence of feet, as in the case of a snake. Metaphorically, it can describe a feeling of instability or lack of grounding, like someone who feels lost or unrooted. Because it's not a common word, it's more likely to be encountered in literature or academic writing where precise and evocative language is used.

These ions can then attach to pollutants in the air, such as dust, pollen, and smoke, causing them to become heavier and fall out of the air. Some ionisers also produce ozone, which is a powerful oxidant that can kill bacteria and viruses. However, ozone can also be harmful to human health, so it is important to choose an ioniser that does not produce excessive amounts of ozone.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ I bought a new ionizer for my car.","correct":"✓ I bought a new ioniser for my car.","note":"The correct spelling in British English is 'ioniser' with an 's', while in American English, 'ionizer' with a 'z' is common."}],"priority":"★★★"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["ionise","ionize","ionisation","ionization","ion"],"phrasal_verbs":[]},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"Unknown","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"B2","text":"The word 'ioniser' refers to a device that produces ions, typically used to purify air.

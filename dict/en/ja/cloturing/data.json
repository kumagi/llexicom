It is typically used when a minority group is attempting to delay or block a vote through extended debate (filibustering). The process of 'cloturing' involves a vote to end the debate, and if successful, the debate is limited, and a vote on the main issue is scheduled. This term is most often encountered in political science, law, and news reports about legislative proceedings."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The opposition party fiercely resisted the cloturing of the bill.","translation":"野党は法案の打ち切りに激しく抵抗した。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"Act of applying cloture"},{"sentence":"The speaker announced the cloturing of the session to ensure a vote before the deadline.","translation":"議長は締め切り前に投票を確実にするため、セッションの打ち切りを発表した。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"Process of ending debate"}],"japanese_reading":{"katakana":"クロージャーリング","romaji":"kuroojaaringu"}}

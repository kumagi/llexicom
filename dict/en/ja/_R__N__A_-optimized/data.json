It describes RNA molecules that have been specifically designed or modified to work more effectively in biological systems. This often involves improving the stability of the RNA, increasing the amount of protein it can produce, or making it more compatible with cellular machinery. Understanding this term requires some background knowledge in genetics and molecular biology.

It is formed by combining \"east\" with the suffix \"-ermost,\" which indicates the superlative degree (i.e., the furthest or most extreme). While \"eastermost\" is technically correct, the more common and widely accepted term is \"easternmost.\" Therefore, it is generally advisable to use \"easternmost\" in writing and speech to ensure clarity and avoid potential confusion. This word is primarily used in geographical or descriptive contexts where precise location is important."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The eastermost islands of the archipelago are largely uninhabited.","translation":"その群島の最も東にある島々は、ほとんどが無人島です。","type":"descriptive","meaning_category":"geographical location"},{"sentence":"The eastermost edge of the forest was marked by a steep cliff.","translation":"その森の最も東の端は、切り立った崖によって区切られていました。","type":"descriptive","meaning_category":"geographical location"}]}

It is more often found in literature or formal contexts than in everyday conversation. Understanding this word can enhance comprehension of older texts or more formal writing, but it is not essential for basic communication. The word is formed from 'nurse' (in the sense of suckling) and the suffix '-ling', which indicates something small or young. Because of its limited use, it is not a high-priority word for language learners."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The artist captured the tenderness of the mother-nursling bond.","translation":"その芸術家は母と乳飲み子の絆の優しさを捉えた。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"乳飲み子"},{"sentence":"In the olden days, the death of a nursling was a common tragedy.","translation":"昔は、乳飲み子の死はよくある悲劇だった。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"乳飲み子"}]}

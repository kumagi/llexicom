A central tenet of Malebranchism is occasionalism, the view that God is the only true causal agent in the universe. According to this view, what appear to be causal interactions between finite beings are actually occasions for God to act. In other words, when one billiard ball strikes another, it is not the first ball that causes the second to move, but rather God who causes the second ball to move on the occasion of the first ball's impact.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Malebranchism believed in the power of human reason alone.","correct":"✓ Malebranchism believed in divine intervention as necessary for human understanding.","note":"Malebranchism emphasizes the necessity of divine intervention for human understanding, not the power of human reason alone."}],"priority":"★☆☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["Malebranchist (名詞/形容詞: マールブランシュ主義者/の)"],"phrases":["Vision in God (神における観照)","Occasionalism (機会原因論)"],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"非常に低頻度 (Very low frequency) - 哲学史の専門用語。","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"Malebranchism is a complex philosophical system attributed to Nicolas Malebranche.

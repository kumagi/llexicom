It can be a primary articulation, as in the case of labial consonants like /p/, /b/, and /m/, or a secondary articulation, where it accompanies another primary articulation. In phonetics and phonology, understanding labialisation is crucial for describing and differentiating various sounds across languages. The term is often used interchangeably with 'labialization', though 'labialisation' is more common in British English.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The labialisation is when you use your tongue.","correct":"✓ Labialisation is when you use your lips.","note":"Labialisation involves the lips, not the tongue."},{"incorrect":"✗ Delabialisation is adding lip rounding.","correct":"✓ Delabialisation is removing lip rounding.","note":"Delabialisation is the opposite of labialisation; it's the removal of lip rounding."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["labial (adjective: 唇の、唇音の)","labialize (verb: 唇音化する)","labialized (adjective: 唇音化された)","delabialise (verb: 脱唇音化する)","delabialised (adjective: 脱唇音化された)"],"related_terms":["articulation (調音)","phonetics (音声学)","phonology (音韻論)","consonant (子音)","vowel (母音)","rounding (円唇化)"],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2 (専門的な言語学の文脈)","frequency_google_ngram":"低頻度 (Low frequency) - 音声学、音韻論の専門用語。","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Labialisation' is a technical term in phonetics and phonology that describes the process of rounding or protruding the lips while producing a sound.

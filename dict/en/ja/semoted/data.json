It is formed as the opposite of 'remoted,' meaning to bring something back from a remote location. Because it is not part of standard English vocabulary, it should be used with caution and awareness of the audience's understanding. It's more likely to be encountered in technical or specialized contexts where 'remoted' is already in use. A more common and widely understood verb, such as 'returned' or 'brought back,' is generally preferred in formal communication."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"After the project ended, we semoted all the equipment from the field site.","translation":"プロジェクト終了後、すべての機材を現場から回収した。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"bring back from a remote location"}]}

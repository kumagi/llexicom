They are characterized by their high proline and glutamine content and their solubility in alcohol-water mixtures. Different cereal grains contain different types of prolamines, such as gliadin in wheat, zein in corn, hordein in barley, and secalin in rye. These proteins play a role in the nutritional value and processing properties of the grains. In some individuals, prolamines, particularly gliadin, can trigger an immune response, leading to conditions like celiac disease.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Prolamine is a type of carbohydrate.","correct":"✓ Prolamine is a type of protein.","note":"Prolamine is a protein, not a carbohydrate."},{"incorrect":"✗ Prolamine is soluble in water.","correct":"✓ Prolamine is soluble in alcohol.","note":"Prolamine is soluble in alcohol, not water."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["proline (名詞: プロリン)","glutamine (名詞: グルタミン)","gluten (名詞: グルテン)","gliadin (名詞: グリアジン)","zein (名詞: ゼイン)","hordein (名詞: ホルデイン)","secalin (名詞: セカリン)"],"phrasal_verbs":[],"priority":"★★★"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Prolamine' refers to a specific type of protein found in grains like wheat, corn, and barley.

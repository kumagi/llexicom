It is used to produce a bainitic microstructure, which offers improved toughness, ductility, and strength compared to traditional quenching and tempering. The process involves quenching the metal from its austenitizing temperature into a bath (typically salt or oil) held at a constant temperature within the bainite transformation range, and holding it there until the austenite fully transforms into bainite.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[],"priority":"★☆☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["austempered (adjective)","austempering (noun/gerund)"],"phrasal_verbs":[],"priority":"★☆☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"N/A","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C2","text":"'Austemper' is a technical term used in metallurgy and materials science. It refers to a specific heat treatment process for steel and cast iron, designed to produce a bainitic microstructure.

Its coarse-grained texture is due to this slow cooling process, which allows large crystals to form. It is chemically similar to basalt, but basalt is an extrusive rock, meaning it cools quickly on the Earth's surface and has a fine-grained texture.","priority":"★☆☆"},"common_mistakes":{},"related_words":{"derivatives":["gabbroic (adjective)"],"phrasal_verbs":[]},"level_frequency":{},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"Gabbro is a geological term referring to a specific type of igneous rock.

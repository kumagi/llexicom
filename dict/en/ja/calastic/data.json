It describes rocks and sediments composed of fragments derived from pre-existing rocks or minerals. This term is less common than its synonym, 'clastic', but understanding it is beneficial for advanced studies in geology and related fields. The key concept is that these materials are not formed chemically or organically in place, but are the result of physical breakdown and transportation of other materials."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The sandstone is a calastic rock composed mainly of quartz grains.","translation":"その砂岩は、主に石英の粒子からなる砕屑岩です。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"geology"},{"sentence":"Calastic sediments are often found in river deltas and coastal environments.","translation":"砕屑性堆積物は、河川の三角州や沿岸環境でよく見られます。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"geology"}]}

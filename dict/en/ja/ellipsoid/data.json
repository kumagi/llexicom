It can be formed by rotating an ellipse about one of its axes. If the ellipse is rotated about its major axis, the resulting ellipsoid is called a prolate ellipsoid (elongated). If it is rotated about its minor axis, the resulting ellipsoid is called an oblate ellipsoid (flattened). A sphere is a special case of an ellipsoid where all three axes are equal.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The shape is ellipseoid.","correct":"✓ The shape is ellipsoid.","note":"The correct term is 'ellipsoid', not 'ellipseoid'."},{"incorrect":"✗ Ellipsoid is a 2D shape.","correct":"✓ Ellipsoid is a 3D shape.","note":"An ellipsoid is a three-dimensional shape, while an ellipse is a two-dimensional shape."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["ellipsoidal (adjective)"],"related_terms":["ellipse","sphere","spheroid","oblate spheroid","prolate spheroid"],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency.

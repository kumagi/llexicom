In entomology, it denotes the plural of 'phasmid', which are insects of the order Phasmida, known for their remarkable camouflage. They are commonly called stick insects or leaf insects due to their resemblance to twigs and leaves.\n2.  In developmental biology, 'phasmids' refers to a pair of sensory neurons found in the tail region of nematodes (roundworms) and other invertebrates.

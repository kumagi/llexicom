It describes something that is like a 'phantom' – ghostly, unreal, or existing only in your imagination.

Because it's not a common word, it's best used in writing or speech where you want to create a specific, evocative effect. It suggests something that is not quite real and perhaps a little mysterious."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The old house had a phantomical appearance in the moonlight.","translation":"その古い家は月明かりの中で幽霊のような外観をしていた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"幽霊のような"},{"sentence":"His dreams were filled with phantomical creatures and landscapes.","translation":"彼の夢は幻影的な生き物や風景で満たされていた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"幻影的な"},{"sentence":"She chased after a phantomical ideal of perfect happiness.","translation":"彼女は完璧な幸福という非現実的な理想を追い求めた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"非現実的な"}]}

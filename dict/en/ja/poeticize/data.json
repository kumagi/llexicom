It can involve focusing on beauty, emotion, or symbolic meaning, sometimes at the expense of accuracy or realism. The verb can be used both when someone is writing poetry or when they are describing something in a poetic way. It often carries a slightly critical connotation, suggesting that the subject is being presented in an overly romantic or unrealistic light.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ She poeticized the fact.","correct":"✓ She poeticized the event.","note":"'Fact' is usually presented as it is, without embellishment.

It often implies adding beauty or romanticism to a subject, sometimes to the point of making it seem unrealistic. It is used in contexts where someone is transforming ordinary or even unpleasant things into something beautiful or meaningful through language or art. It's a more advanced word, so it's not typically encountered in everyday conversation or writing. Understanding the word requires a good grasp of the nuances of language and the concept of poetic expression."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The author **poeticized** the harsh realities of rural life, focusing on the resilience of the people.","translation":"その作家は農村生活の厳しい現実を詩的に表現し、人々の不屈の精神に焦点を当てた。","type":"verb (vt)","meaning_category":"美化する"},{"sentence":"He **poeticized** about the beauty of the sunset in his journal.","translation":"彼は日記に夕日の美しさについて詩的に書いた。","type":"verb (vi)","meaning_category":"詩を作る"},{"sentence":"The artist **poeticized** the industrial landscape, transforming factories into objects of beauty.","translation":"その芸術家は工業地帯を詩的に表現し、工場を美の対象に変えた。","type":"verb (vt)","meaning_category":"詩的に表現する"}]}

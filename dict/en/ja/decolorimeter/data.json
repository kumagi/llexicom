It works by shining light through or onto the sample and measuring the amount of light that is transmitted or reflected. The instrument then provides a numerical representation of the color, which can be used for quality control, research, and other applications. It is more precise than human visual assessment.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The decolorimeter give a wrong reading.","correct":"✓ The decolorimeter gives a wrong reading.","note":"The subject 'decolorimeter' is singular, so the verb should be 'gives'."},{"incorrect":"✗ Use the decolorimeter to measure the color, it's very accurate.","correct":"✓ Use the decolorimeter to measure the color; it's very accurate. / ✓ Use the decolorimeter to measure the color, because it's very accurate.","note":"Two independent clauses should be separated by a semicolon or connected with a conjunction like 'because'."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["decolorimetry (noun: the science of color measurement using a decolorimeter)"],"phrasal_verbs":[],"related_terms":["colorimetry","spectroscopy","chromaticity","absorbance","transmittance"],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"The term 'decolorimeter' is a technical term primarily used in scientific and industrial contexts. It refers to a specific instrument used for measuring color objectively. Understanding its function and application generally requires a background in science, engineering, or a related field.

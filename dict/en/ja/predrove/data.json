It's formed by adding the prefix 'pre-' to 'drove,' indicating an action completed in advance. Due to its infrequent use, it's more likely to appear in formal writing or technical contexts where emphasizing the timing of the driving action is important. Understanding the prefix 'pre-' is helpful in deciphering the meaning of this word."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The support team predrove the vehicles to the base camp before the climbers arrived.","translation":"支援チームは登山者が到着する前に、車両をベースキャンプまで予め運転しました。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"予め運転した"}]}

The Latin word is formed from 'sub' (under) and 'tela' (web), referring to the fine threads of a web.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/ˈsʌtəlst/","syllables":"sut-tlest"},"inflection":{"adjective_forms":{"base":"subtle","comparative":"subtler/more subtle","superlative":"subtlest/most subtle"}},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Subtlest' is used to describe something that possesses the highest degree of subtlety.

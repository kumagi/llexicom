It can also be used more figuratively to describe meanings or interpretations that are heavily reliant on context or nuance. In the botanical sense, it indicates that the organism requires shade for optimal growth or survival, often because it is sensitive to direct sunlight. In the figurative sense, it suggests that the meaning is not straightforward and requires careful consideration of the surrounding circumstances.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The shade-dependent plant was placed in direct sunlight and died.","correct":"✓ The shade-dependent plant was placed in direct sunlight and died.","note":"This is a correct statement, illustrating the vulnerability of shade-dependent plants to direct sunlight."},{"incorrect":"✗ His argument is completely shade-dependent and makes no sense.","correct":"✓ His argument is highly shade-dependent and difficult to understand without context.","note":"The argument is not necessarily nonsensical, but rather requires context for proper understanding."}],"priority":"★☆☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["shade (noun)","dependent (adjective)","dependence (noun)"],"phrases":["shade-tolerant","sun-dependent","context-dependent"],"priority":"★☆☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"The term \"shade-dependent\" describes something that relies on shade, typically a plant or organism needing shade to grow well.

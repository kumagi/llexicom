It can be a substance that numbs physical sensations, or a process or agent that reduces emotional reactivity. It is often used in medical and psychological contexts. The word is formed by adding the prefix 'de-' (meaning 'remove' or 'reduce') to 'sensitizer,' which is something that increases sensitivity.

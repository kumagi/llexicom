It refers to a specific operation on data structures like arrays or bit strings. Imagine the data structure as a circle; a right-rotate shifts each element one or more positions to the right, with the elements that \"fall off\" the end being re-inserted at the beginning. This is a circular shift, preserving all the original data. It's different from a regular \"right shift,\" which typically discards the shifted elements and fills the vacated spots with zeros.

Some languages, like French and Portuguese, have contrastive nasal vowels, meaning that the presence or absence of nasalization can change the meaning of a word.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Nasalisation is when you have a cold.","correct":"✓ Nasalization is a phonetic process where sounds become nasal.","note":"Having a cold causes nasal speech, but nasalization is a specific phonetic phenomenon.

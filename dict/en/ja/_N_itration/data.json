This reaction is commonly performed using a mixture of concentrated nitric acid and sulfuric acid. The sulfuric acid acts as a catalyst, enhancing the electrophilicity of the nitric acid. Nitration is crucial in the synthesis of explosives (like TNT), pharmaceuticals, dyes, and various other organic compounds. The reaction conditions (temperature, concentration of acids) must be carefully controlled to prevent unwanted side reactions or over-nitration.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The nitration was make by nitric acid.","correct":"✓ The nitration was done/carried out/performed using nitric acid.","note":"'Make' is not typically used in a formal scientific context to describe a process.

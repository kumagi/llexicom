Something that has 'blatancy' is done in an extremely obvious and often offensive way, without any attempt to hide or disguise it.

It suggests that something is done without any attempt to hide it, even if it's wrong or inappropriate. For example, you might talk about the 'blatancy' of a lie if someone is telling a lie that is very easy to see through. Because it's a more nuanced word, it's not as commonly used as simpler words like 'obviousness'. It is often used in formal writing or when discussing ethical issues.","example_sentences":[]},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The **blatancy** of the advertisement's false claims was appalling.","translation":"その広告の虚偽の主張の露骨さにはぞっとした。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"露骨さ"},{"sentence":"The politician's **blatancy** in accepting bribes was widely condemned.","translation":"政治家が賄賂を受け取るあからさまなやり方は広く非難された。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"あからさまさ"},{"sentence":"The **blatancy** of the error suggested a deliberate attempt to mislead.","translation":"その誤りの見え透いたやり方は、意図的な誤解を招く試みを示唆していた。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"見え透いたこと"}]}

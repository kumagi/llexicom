It is a compound word that combines 'she' (referring to a female) and 'pig'. However, its usage can be tricky due to its potential to be offensive. While it can simply refer to a female pig, it is more often used as a derogatory term for a woman, similar to calling someone a 'bitch' or 'hag'. Therefore, it's important to be aware of the context in which it is used to avoid causing offense."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The farmer pointed out the she-pig in the pen.","translation":"農夫は囲いの中にいる雌豚を指さした。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"female pig"},{"sentence":"He was out of line when he called her a she-pig.","translation":"彼が彼女を雌豚呼ばわりしたのは行き過ぎだった。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"derogatory term for a woman"}]}

It's formed by adding the prefix 'un-' to a less common adjective derived from 'persecute,' used here to imply a following or sequential nature. Because of its rarity and the availability of clearer synonyms like 'non-sequential' or 'disordered,' it is generally not recommended for use, especially in contexts where clarity is paramount.

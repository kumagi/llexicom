It is particularly important in determining the protein content in food and other biological samples, as the nitrogen content is related to the protein content. The method involves digesting the sample with strong acid, converting the nitrogen into ammonium, and then quantifying the ammonium.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ I used the kheldal method.","correct":"✓ I used the Kjeldahl method.","note":"The correct spelling is 'Kjeldahl' with a capital 'K' and 'j'."},{"incorrect":"✗ Kjeldahl is a process to measure carbon.","correct":"✓ Kjeldahl is a process to measure nitrogen.","note":"The Kjeldahl method measures nitrogen, not carbon."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["Kjeldahl flask (ケルダールフラスコ)","Kjeldahl digestion (ケルダール分解)"],"phrasal_verbs":[],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency, primarily used in scientific and technical contexts.","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"The term 'Kjeldahl' refers to a specific chemical method used for determining the nitrogen content in substances.

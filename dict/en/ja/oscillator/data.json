These circuits are fundamental in various electronic devices for generating clock signals, radio frequencies, and other timing signals. Different types of oscillators exist, such as crystal oscillators, which use the piezoelectric effect of quartz crystals to generate highly stable frequencies, and voltage-controlled oscillators (VCOs), where the frequency can be adjusted by varying the input voltage. Understanding oscillators requires knowledge of basic electronic components and circuit theory.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The **oscillator** in the radio receiver helps to tune into different stations.","translation":"ラジオ受信機の発振器は、異なる放送局に同調するのに役立ちます。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"発振器"},{"sentence":"A stable **oscillator** is crucial for accurate timing in digital circuits.","translation":"安定した発振器は、デジタル回路における正確なタイミングに不可欠です。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"発振器"},{"sentence":"The engineer designed a new **oscillator** circuit with improved frequency stability.","translation":"そのエンジニアは、周波数安定性を改善した新しい発振器回路を設計しました。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"発振器"}]}

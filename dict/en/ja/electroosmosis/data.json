This occurs because the surface of the material has an electrical charge, which attracts ions of the opposite charge in the liquid. When an electric field is applied, these ions migrate towards the electrode of opposite polarity, dragging the liquid with them. It's often used in microfluidics, soil remediation, and chemical separation.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ electro-osmosis","correct":"✓ electroosmosis","note":"The term is generally written as one word, without a hyphen."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["electroosmotic","osmosis","electrophoresis","microfluidics"],"phrasal_verbs":[]},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low","priority":"★★☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"Electroosmosis is a scientific term referring to the movement of liquid through a porous material under the influence of an electric field.

Sounds that should normally have a nasal component (like /m/, /n/, and /ŋ/ in English) sound 'blocked' or 'stuffy'.

This is often due to a blockage in the nasal passages. The word is formed from 'hypo-' (meaning 'under' or 'below'), 'nasal' (relating to the nose), and '-ity' (denoting a state or condition). It is the opposite of 'hypernasality', which is excessive nasal resonance.

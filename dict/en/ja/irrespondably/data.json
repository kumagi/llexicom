'Irrespondable' is constructed from the prefix 'ir-' (meaning 'not'), the root word 'respond', and the suffix '-able' (meaning 'able to be'). Thus, it literally means 'not able to be responded to' or 'not admitting of response'.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/ˌɪrɪˈspɒndəbli/","syllables":"ir-re-spon-da-bly"},"inflection":{"notes":"Adverbs do not typically inflect."},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Irrespondably' is used to describe something that is so clear or conclusive that it cannot be reasonably disputed or denied.

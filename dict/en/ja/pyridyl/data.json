Pyridine is a heterocyclic aromatic organic compound with the formula C5H5N. A pyridyl group is formed when one hydrogen atom is removed from the pyridine ring. The position from which the hydrogen atom is removed can vary, leading to different isomers such as 2-pyridyl, 3-pyridyl, and 4-pyridyl. These groups are commonly found in various chemical compounds and are used as ligands in coordination chemistry.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ pyridile","correct":"✓ pyridyl","note":"The correct spelling is 'pyridyl', not 'pyridile'."},{"incorrect":"✗ pyridyl is a element.","correct":"✓ pyridyl is a radical.","note":"Pyridyl is a radical (a group of atoms) not an element."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["pyridine","bipyridine"],"phrasal_verbs":[],"priority":"★★★"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"N/A","frequency_google_ngram":"Low","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Pyridyl' is a technical term in organic chemistry, specifically referring to a chemical group derived from pyridine.

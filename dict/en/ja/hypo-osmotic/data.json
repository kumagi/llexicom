Because of this difference in concentration, water will tend to move into the solution with the higher concentration (in this case, the cell), which can cause the cell to swell. Understanding this term requires knowledge of basic concepts like osmosis and concentration gradients."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"Distilled water is a hypo-osmotic solution relative to blood plasma.","translation":"蒸留水は血漿に対して低浸透圧溶液である。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"low osmotic pressure"},{"sentence":"The fish adapted to the hypo-osmotic environment of freshwater.","translation":"その魚は淡水の低浸透圧環境に適応した。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"low osmotic pressure"}]}

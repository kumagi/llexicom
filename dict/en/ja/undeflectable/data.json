It is formed by adding the prefix 'un-' (meaning 'not') and the suffix '-able' (meaning 'capable of') to the word 'deflect'. Therefore, 'undeflectable' means 'not capable of being deflected' or 'not able to be turned aside'. It can be used in both physical and abstract contexts to describe something that is resistant to change in direction or influence.

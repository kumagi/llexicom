Since the boiling point decreases with decreasing atmospheric pressure, and atmospheric pressure decreases with increasing altitude, the boiling point can be used to calculate the altitude.

This method is based on the principle that the boiling point of a liquid decreases as atmospheric pressure decreases, which in turn is related to altitude.

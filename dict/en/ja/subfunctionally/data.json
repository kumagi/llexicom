It is often used in technical or scientific contexts. To understand it, break it down: 'sub-' means 'less than' or 'below,' and 'functionally' means 'in a functional manner.' Therefore, 'subfunctionally' means 'less than fully functional.' For example, if a machine is described as operating subfunctionally, it means it is working, but not as well as it should be."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The mutated enzyme was found to be subfunctionally active compared to the wild-type enzyme.","translation":"変異した酵素は、野生型酵素と比較して機能的に不完全に活性化されていることがわかった。","type":"general"},{"sentence":"The damaged tissue was subfunctionally perfused, leading to slower healing.","translation":"損傷した組織は機能的に不完全に灌流され、治癒が遅くなった。","type":"medical"},{"sentence":"The software module was operating subfunctionally, causing intermittent errors.","translation":"ソフトウェアモジュールは機能的に不完全に動作しており、断続的なエラーが発生していた。","type":"technical"}]}

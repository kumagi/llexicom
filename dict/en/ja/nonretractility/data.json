Understanding its meaning requires familiarity with anatomical and physiological concepts, particularly those related to retractile organs and tissues. Due to its limited usage and technical nature, it is unlikely to be encountered by non-experts. The word is formed by adding the prefix 'non-' to 'retractility', which means the ability to be retracted. Therefore, 'nonretractility' simply means the inability to be retracted."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The patient presented with nonretractility of the foreskin, indicating a case of phimosis.","translation":"患者は包皮が後退しない状態で来院し、包茎の症例を示唆した。","type":"general","meaning_category":"medical"},{"sentence":"The study examined the nonretractility of the turtle's head as a defense mechanism.","translation":"その研究は、防御機構としてのカメの頭が引っ込まない状態を調査した。","type":"biology","meaning_category":"biology"}]}

It is rarely used in practice because it is not permitted under IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards) and is not common under US GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles). It assumes that the most expensive inventory items are sold first. This can have tax implications, especially in times of inflation.\n\n2.  **Investing (Buying High, Selling Low):** This is an informal term referring to the practice of buying an asset at a high price and subsequently selling it at a lower price, resulting in a loss.

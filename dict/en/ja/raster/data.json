Raster images are stored with each pixel individually represented. Vector graphics, on the other hand, use geometric primitives (points, lines, curves, polygons) to represent images.

It refers to a grid-based representation of an image, where the image is composed of individual pixels arranged in rows and columns. Understanding the concept of rasters is essential for working with digital images, especially when dealing with image editing, display technologies, and printing. The verb 'rasterize' means to convert a vector-based image (defined by mathematical equations) into a raster image (defined by pixels). This process is often necessary for displaying vector images on devices that use raster displays, such as computer monitors and printers."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The photograph was saved as a high-resolution **raster** image.","translation":"その写真は高解像度のラスタ画像として保存された。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"ラスタ画像"},{"sentence":"The graphics card is responsible for **rasterizing** the 3D models.","translation":"グラフィックスカードは3Dモデルをラスタライズする役割を担っている。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"ラスタライズする"},{"sentence":"**Raster** graphics are commonly used for photographs and other realistic images.","translation":"ラスタグラフィックスは、写真やその他のリアルな画像によく使用される。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"ラスタグラフィックス"},{"sentence":"The software allows you to **rasterize** text for better compatibility with certain printers.","translation":"そのソフトウェアを使用すると、特定のプリンターとの互換性を高めるためにテキストをラスタライズできる。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"ラスタライズする"}]}

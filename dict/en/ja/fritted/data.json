This involves partially fusing raw materials by heating them together, creating a new, more stable compound. The resulting 'frit' is then ground into a powder and used in glazes, enamels, or other applications. The process is used to render otherwise soluble or toxic materials insoluble and safe to handle.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The fritted is ready to use.","correct":"✓ The frit is ready to use.","note":"'Fritted' is an adjective or a past participle, describing something that has been fritted.

It refers to the deliberate reduction of the number of bits used to represent numerical values, typically floating-point numbers. This is often done to reduce memory consumption, accelerate computations, or improve energy efficiency, especially in resource-constrained environments such as embedded systems or mobile devices. However, precision-lowering can also lead to a loss of accuracy, so it's important to carefully consider the trade-offs involved.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The precision-lowering made the results completely inaccurate.","correct":"✓ The precision-lowering introduced some inaccuracies in the results.","note":"Precision-lowering usually introduces *some* inaccuracies, but rarely makes results *completely* inaccurate.

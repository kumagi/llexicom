It is particularly useful when you want to compare multiple groups simultaneously, rather than performing multiple t-tests, which can increase the risk of Type I errors.

It's helpful when you want to see if there's a real difference between the groups, rather than just random chance. ANOVA works by looking at how much the data varies within each group compared to how much it varies between the groups. If the variation between groups is much larger than the variation within groups, it suggests there's a significant difference between the group means. It's commonly used in scientific research, experiments, and surveys to analyze data and draw conclusions."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The researchers conducted an ANOVA to determine if there were significant differences in test scores between the different teaching methods.","translation":"研究者たちは、異なる教育方法の間でテストのスコアに有意差があるかどうかを判断するために分散分析を実施しました。","type":"general","meaning_category":"definition"},{"sentence":"A one-way ANOVA was used to compare the effectiveness of three different drugs.","translation":"3つの異なる薬の効果を比較するために、一元配置分散分析が使用されました。","type":"specific","meaning_category":"example"},{"sentence":"The ANOVA results indicated that there was a statistically significant effect of the intervention on the outcome variable.","translation":"分散分析の結果は、介入が結果変数に統計的に有意な影響を与えたことを示しました。","type":"result","meaning_category":"outcome"}]}

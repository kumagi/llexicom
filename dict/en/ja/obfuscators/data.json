'Obfuscate' comes from the Latin 'obfuscare,' meaning 'to darken.' The suffix '-or' indicates an agent or instrument that performs the action. Therefore, an 'obfuscator' is something that makes code obscure.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/ˈɒbfʌskeɪtərz/","syllables":"ob-fus-ca-tors"},"inflection":{"noun_plural":"obfuscators"},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Obfuscators' specifically refers to tools used to transform code (usually source code or bytecode) into a form that is functionally equivalent but harder to read and understand. This is a security measure used to protect intellectual property, prevent tampering, or make reverse engineering more difficult. The effectiveness of obfuscators varies, and skilled reverse engineers can often deobfuscate code, but it raises the barrier to entry.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ He used obfuscator to protect the document.","correct":"✓ He used an obfuscator to protect the code.","note":"Obfuscators are primarily used for code, not documents.

Imagine taking a clear set of instructions and scrambling them up so that only a computer can still follow them easily, but a person would have a very hard time figuring out what the instructions mean. That's what obfuscators do to code. They are used to protect software from being copied or tampered with by making it difficult to reverse engineer.

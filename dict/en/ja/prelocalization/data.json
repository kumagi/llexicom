This can include tasks such as: * **Internationalization (i18n):** Ensuring that the product is designed to support multiple languages and regions without requiring engineering changes. * **Content Analysis:** Identifying text strings, images, and other elements that need to be localized. * **Terminology Management:** Creating a glossary of key terms and their translations to ensure consistency across different languages. * **Pseudo-localization:** Testing the product with a simulated localized version to identify potential issues with text expansion, character encoding, and layout.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ We skipped prelocalization and went straight to translation.","correct":"✓ We skipped prelocalization and went straight to localization.","note":"While technically correct, omitting prelocalization can lead to significant problems later in the localization process.

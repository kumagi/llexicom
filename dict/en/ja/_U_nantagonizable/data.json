It is formed from 'antagonize,' meaning to cause someone to become hostile, and the prefix 'un-' meaning 'not,' and the suffix '-able' meaning 'capable of.' Therefore, 'unantagonizable' describes the quality of being resistant to provocation. It's a rare word, so you'll likely encounter it in formal writing or discussions.

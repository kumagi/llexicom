Capacitors are widely used in electronic circuits for various purposes, such as filtering, energy storage, and timing. The amount of energy a capacitor can store is measured by its capacitance, which is expressed in farads (F). Different types of capacitors exist, each with its own characteristics and applications.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The capacitor resist the flow of current.","correct":"✓ The capacitor stores electrical energy.","note":"Capacitors store energy, while resistors resist the flow of current."},{"incorrect":"✗ The capacitor is measured in ohms.","correct":"✓ The capacitor is measured in farads.","note":"Capacitance is measured in farads, while resistance is measured in ohms."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["capacitance (noun)","capacitive (adjective)"],"related_terms":["charge","discharge","voltage","current","farad","dielectric"],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"B2","frequency_google_ngram":"Relatively low frequency, but common in technical contexts.","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"A **capacitor** is a device that stores electrical energy. It's a key part in many electronic circuits. Think of it like a tiny battery that can charge and discharge very quickly. The amount of energy it can store is called its capacitance, measured in farads. You'll find different types of capacitors used for various jobs, like smoothing out power supplies or filtering signals. Understanding capacitors is essential for anyone working with electronics.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The circuit board has several capacitors.","translation":"回路基板にはいくつかのコンデンサがあります。","type":"general","meaning_category":"component"},{"sentence":"The capacitor is used to smooth out the voltage.","translation":"コンデンサは電圧を安定させるために使用されます。","type":"application","meaning_category":"application"},{"sentence":"The capacitance of the capacitor is 10 microfarads.","translation":"コンデンサの静電容量は10マイクロファラッドです。","type":"technical specification","meaning_category":"technical specification"}]}

It describes systems or applications where the manipulation of pointers (memory addresses) is central to the program's logic or user interaction. This term is often used to describe user interfaces where the primary mode of interaction involves using a mouse or other pointing device to manipulate on-screen elements. It can also describe data structures or algorithms that heavily rely on pointers for efficient memory management and data access.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The car is pointer-driven.","correct":"✓ The car has power steering.","note":"'Pointer-driven' is specific to computing contexts.

It means that something, like a program or user interface, is controlled by using 'pointers.' In programming, a pointer is like an address that tells the computer where to find specific information in its memory. So, a 'pointer-driven' system is one where the program's actions depend on how these pointers are used and changed. This term is not commonly used outside of technical discussions about software and computer systems."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The game's physics engine is pointer-driven, allowing for realistic interactions between objects.","translation":"このゲームの物理エンジンはポインタ駆動であり、オブジェクト間のリアルなインタラクションを可能にします。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"ポインタによって操作される"},{"sentence":"Many embedded systems use pointer-driven techniques to optimize memory usage.","translation":"多くの組み込みシステムは、メモリ使用量を最適化するためにポインタ駆動の手法を使用しています。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"ポインタによって操作される"}]}

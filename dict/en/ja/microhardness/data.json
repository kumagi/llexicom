It is typically determined by indenting the material with a very small indenter under a light load. This technique is particularly useful for characterizing the hardness of small features, thin films, or heterogeneous materials. Common microhardness tests include Vickers and Knoop hardness tests. The results are usually expressed in units of Vickers hardness (HV) or Knoop hardness (HK).","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The material has a high microhard.","correct":"✓ The material has a high microhardness.","note":"'Microhard' is not the correct term.

This is usually done using a special machine that presses a tiny, pointed object into the surface of the material. The size of the dent that's left behind tells you how hard the material is. This is particularly useful for testing thin coatings or very small parts where regular hardness tests wouldn't work well.

{"word":"XTAL","priority":"★☆☆","meanings":[{"part_of_speech":"noun","definition":"水晶振動子（クリスタル）","english_definition":"(electronics) Abbreviation for crystal oscillator. A crystal oscillator is an electronic circuit that uses the mechanical resonance of a vibrating crystal of piezoelectric material to create an electrical signal with a very precise frequency. This frequency is commonly used to keep track of time (as in quartz wristwatches), provide a stable clock signal for digital integrated circuits, and to stabilize frequencies for radio transmitters/receivers.","examples":[{"sentence":"The microcontroller uses an 8MHz XTAL.","translation":"そのマイクロコントローラは8MHzの水晶振動子を使用しています。"},{"sentence":"Replace the XTAL with a higher frequency one to increase the clock speed.","translation":"クロック速度を上げるために、水晶振動子を高周波のものと交換してください。"}],"collocations":["8MHz XTAL","high frequency XTAL","replace XTAL","XTAL oscillator","quartz XTAL"],"synonyms":["crystal oscillator","quartz crystal","crystal"],"antonyms":[]}],"etymology":{"value":"Abbreviation of 'crystal'.","priority":"★★★"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/ˈkrɪstl/","syllables":"kris-tal"},"inflection":{"noun_plural":"XTALs"},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'XTAL' is an abbreviation used in electronics schematics, datasheets, and technical documentation.

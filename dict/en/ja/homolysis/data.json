It describes the process where a covalent bond is broken symmetrically, with each of the original atoms retaining one electron. This results in the formation of free radicals, which are highly reactive species. Homolysis is often initiated by high temperatures, UV radiation, or the presence of radical initiators. It is important to distinguish homolysis from heterolysis, where the bond breaks unevenly, resulting in the formation of ions.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Homolysis produces ions.","correct":"✓ Homolysis produces radicals.","note":"Homolysis generates free radicals, not ions.

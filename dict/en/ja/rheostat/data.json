It functions by varying the amount of resistance in the circuit, thereby controlling the flow of current. It's often used in applications where precise control of current is needed, such as in lighting systems, motor speed control, and heating elements. While the term 'potentiometer' is sometimes used interchangeably, a potentiometer is technically a three-terminal device used to control voltage, although it can be wired as a rheostat.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The rheostat controls the voltage.","correct":"✓ The rheostat controls the current.","note":"Rheostats control current, while potentiometers can control voltage (or current if wired as a rheostat)."},{"incorrect":"✗ Use a rheostat to measure resistance.","correct":"✓ Use a multimeter to measure resistance.","note":"A rheostat is used to vary resistance, not measure it.

It's used to control the amount of electrical current flowing through a circuit. Imagine a dimmer switch for lights - that's a common application of a rheostat. By adjusting the rheostat, you change the resistance, which in turn changes the current and dims or brightens the light. Rheostats are typically wire-wound and have two terminals. While similar to potentiometers, rheostats are specifically designed to control current, whereas potentiometers are designed to control voltage (though they can be configured to control current as well)."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The technician adjusted the **rheostat** to fine-tune the motor speed.","translation":"技術者はモーターの速度を微調整するためにレオスタットを調整した。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"可変抵抗器"},{"sentence":"The old lighting system used a **rheostat** to control the brightness of the stage lights.","translation":"古い照明システムは舞台照明の明るさを制御するためにレオスタットを使用していた。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"可変抵抗器"},{"sentence":"By turning the knob on the **rheostat**, the current flowing through the heating element could be precisely regulated.","translation":"レオスタットのノブを回すことで、発熱体を流れる電流を正確に調整できた。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"可変抵抗器"}]}

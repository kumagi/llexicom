They are responsible for breaking down dietary disaccharides (such as sucrose, lactose, and maltose) into monosaccharides (such as glucose, fructose, and galactose), which can then be absorbed into the bloodstream. Deficiencies in specific disaccharidases can lead to digestive problems, such as lactose intolerance.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Disaccharidase is a type of disaccharide.","correct":"✓ Disaccharidase is an enzyme that breaks down disaccharides.","note":"Disaccharidase is an enzyme, not a type of sugar."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["disaccharide","enzyme","hydrolysis","monosaccharide","lactase","sucrase","maltase"],"phrasal_verbs":[],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"The term 'disaccharidase' refers to a specific type of enzyme that breaks down disaccharides into simpler sugars.

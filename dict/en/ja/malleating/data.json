It's derived from the idea of hammering something into a bad shape, metaphorically applying this to how someone is treated. Because it's uncommon, it's best to use more common synonyms like 'mistreating' or 'abusing' unless you specifically want to convey a sense of archaic or deliberate cruelty. It's important not to confuse it with 'malleating' in the context of metalworking, which means making something malleable, not shaping it.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The dictator was known for malleating his political opponents.","translation":"その独裁者は政敵を虐待することで知られていた。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"abuse"},{"sentence":"The company was accused of malleating its workers through unfair labor practices.","translation":"その会社は不当な労働慣行を通じて労働者を虐待していると非難された。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"mistreat"}]}

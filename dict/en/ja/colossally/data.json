It's used to emphasize the scale or degree of something. Because it's derived from 'colossal', which refers to something the size of a giant statue, 'colossally' implies a very significant or impressive magnitude. It's not a commonly used word, so it's more likely to appear in formal writing or when someone wants to create a strong impression.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The debt had grown colossally over the years.","translation":"その借金は長年にわたって途方もなく膨らんだ。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"途方もなく"},{"sentence":"The project was a colossally bad idea from the start.","translation":"そのプロジェクトは最初からとんでもなく悪い考えだった。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"莫大に"},{"sentence":"The company's profits increased colossally after the new marketing campaign.","translation":"新しいマーケティングキャンペーンの後、その会社の利益は莫大に増加した。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"巨大に"}]}

It indicates that the mixture does not contain equal proportions of each isomer. The term is important when the properties of the isomers differ significantly, as the overall properties of the mixture will depend on the isomeric ratio.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The solution was anisomeric because it was not pure.","correct":"✓ The solution was anisomeric because the ratio of isomers was not 1:1.","note":"'Anisomeric' specifically refers to the ratio of isomers, not general purity.

It refers to the process of creating a new, often simpler, polygon mesh over an existing high-resolution model.

The goal is to maintain the shape and details of the original model while creating a more efficient and manageable mesh.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"I need to retro the model.","correct":"I need to retop the model.","note":"The correct term is 'retop', not 'retro'."}],"priority":"★☆☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["retopology (noun)"]},"level_frequency":{"level":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency.

It's often used in the context of materials like oily rags that can spontaneously combust due to internal heat buildup. The term is also associated with the unproven phenomenon of spontaneous human self-combustion, which is a controversial topic with limited scientific evidence. This term is not commonly used in everyday conversation and is more likely to appear in scientific or technical contexts, or discussions about unexplained phenomena."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The pile of oily rags underwent self-combustion, resulting in a fire.","translation":"油まみれのぼろ布の山が自然発火し、火災が発生した。","type":"general","meaning_category":"自然発火"},{"sentence":"The theory of spontaneous human self-combustion remains a mystery.","translation":"人体自然発火の理論は依然として謎のままである。","type":"specific","meaning_category":"人体発火"}]}

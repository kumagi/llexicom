They are sterile cells, meaning they do not produce spores directly. Their function is not always fully understood, but they are thought to aid in spore dispersal, maintain humidity around the developing spores, or act as a defense mechanism.

It refers to a type of specialized cell found on the spore-bearing surfaces of certain fungi. These cells are typically larger than the spore-producing cells (basidia) and come in various shapes.

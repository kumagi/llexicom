It suggests a relaxed and voluntary approach, free from the need to perform the action in a rigid or repetitive manner. It is the opposite of acting 'compulsively,' which implies being driven by an inner urge that is difficult to resist.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ She noncompulsively had to check the door was locked.","correct":"✓ She checked the door was locked noncompulsively.","note":"'Noncompulsively' modifies the verb 'checked,' so it should be placed near the verb.

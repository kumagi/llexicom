It can describe physical environments (e.g., a room with muted sounds), emotional states (e.g., a person expressing themselves with muted emotions), or artistic representations (e.g., a painting with muted colors).

This means something lacks intensity, loudness, brightness, or expressiveness. It is often used in contexts where the absence of strong stimuli is notable, such as in describing a quiet environment, a subdued emotional state, or an artwork with softened colors.

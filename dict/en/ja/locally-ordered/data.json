It describes a set or space where order relations are defined only within specific local regions or neighborhoods. This means that while elements within a given local area can be compared and ordered, there may not be a consistent or defined order relation between elements in different local areas. The concept is important in understanding structures where global ordering is not possible or relevant, but local ordering provides useful information. Outside of mathematics, it can be used more generally to describe data or items that are organized within a specific local context to improve efficiency or relevance within that context."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"In this locally-ordered topological space, each point has a neighborhood where the order is linear.","translation":"この局所的に順序付けられた位相空間では、各点はある近傍を持ち、その近傍内で順序は線形である。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"mathematics"},{"sentence":"The search results are locally-ordered based on relevance to the user's current query within their profile.","translation":"検索結果は、ユーザーのプロファイル内での現在のクエリとの関連性に基づいて局所的に順序付けられている。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"general"},{"sentence":"The database uses a locally-ordered index to speed up queries on frequently accessed records.","translation":"データベースは、頻繁にアクセスされるレコードに対するクエリを高速化するために、局所的に順序付けられたインデックスを使用している。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"computer science"}]}

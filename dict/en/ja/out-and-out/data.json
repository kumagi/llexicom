It often carries a negative connotation, especially when describing someone's character (e.g., \"out-and-out thief\"). However, it can also be used to emphasize positive qualities or outcomes (e.g., \"out-and-out success\"). The phrase is relatively informal and is more common in spoken English than in formal writing.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ He is out and out honest.","correct":"✓ He is an out-and-out honest person.","note":"When used as an adjective, \"out-and-out\" usually precedes a noun.

It's like saying something is 100% that thing. For example, if you call someone an \"out-and-out liar,\" you mean they are a complete and total liar, with no redeeming qualities. It's a strong expression, so it's not used in very formal situations, but it's useful to know when you want to emphasize something is completely true or completely a certain way."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The project was an out-and-out failure from the start.","translation":"そのプロジェクトは最初から完全な失敗だった。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"complete failure"},{"sentence":"He's an out-and-out romantic, always buying flowers and writing poems.","translation":"彼は筋金入りのロマンチストで、いつも花を買ったり詩を書いたりしている。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"complete romantic"},{"sentence":"The team was out-and-out dominant in the championship game.","translation":"そのチームは選手権試合で圧倒的に強かった。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"completely dominant"},{"sentence":"It was an out-and-out pleasure to work with such a dedicated team.","translation":"そのような献身的なチームと働くのは、本当に喜びだった。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"complete pleasure"}]}

Their name is derived from their ability to induce directed chemotaxis in nearby responsive cells; they are chemoattractants. Chemokines are crucial for the recruitment of immune cells to sites of infection and inflammation. They bind to chemokine receptors on the surface of target cells, initiating a signaling cascade that leads to cell migration.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Chemokine are important for immune system.","correct":"✓ Chemokines are important for the immune system.","note":"'Chemokine' is a countable noun, so the plural form 'chemokines' should be used when referring to the class of molecules in general.

The rationale behind this system often involved the idea that the youngest child was most likely to care for the parents in their old age and would therefore be best suited to inherit the family's assets.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ postremogeniture is when the oldest child inherits.","correct":"✓ postremogeniture is when the youngest child inherits.","note":"Postremogeniture is the inheritance by the youngest, not the oldest, child."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":[],"related_terms":["primogeniture","inheritance","succession","ultimogeniture"],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"frequency_google_ngram":"Very low frequency.","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C2","text":"'Postremogeniture' is a specialized term referring to a specific inheritance practice where the youngest child inherits the family estate.

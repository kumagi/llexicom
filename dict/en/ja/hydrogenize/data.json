It's a technical term primarily used in chemistry and food science to describe a process where hydrogen atoms are added to a substance, often to change its properties. For example, liquid vegetable oils are hydrogenized to create solid or semi-solid fats like margarine. The more common term for this process is 'hydrogenate.'"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The company uses a catalyst to hydrogenize the chemical compound.","translation":"その会社は触媒を使って化学化合物を水素化する。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"水素化する"},{"sentence":"Hydrogenizing unsaturated fats increases their stability and shelf life.","translation":"不飽和脂肪酸を水素化すると、安定性と保存期間が向上する。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"水素化する"}]}

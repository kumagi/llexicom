It posits that we can only access the world through the lens of our own thought or consciousness. This view has been critiqued for potentially leading to a closed system where reality outside of human thought becomes inaccessible or unknowable. Key figures associated with discussions around correlativism include Quentin Meillassoux, who critiques it, and Immanuel Kant, whose transcendental idealism is sometimes seen as a precursor to correlativist thought.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Correlativism is the belief that everything is relative.","correct":"✓ Correlativism is the belief that knowledge is always correlated with thought and being.","note":"Correlativism is not simply about relativism.

It posits that individuals always prefer more of a good or service rather than less, even if they already have a substantial amount. This assumption simplifies economic models and allows for the derivation of various conclusions, such as the negative slope of indifference curves. However, it's important to recognize that nonsatiation is an idealization and may not hold in all real-world situations. For example, at some point, an individual may have enough of a particular good and derive no additional utility from consuming more.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The nonsatiation principle means people are never happy.","correct":"✓ The nonsatiation principle means people always prefer more goods.","note":"Nonsatiation does not imply unhappiness, only that more is preferred to less.

It's a key assumption in many economic models, but it's important to remember that it's a simplification of reality. In real life, people might reach a point where they don't want any more of a particular good or service, but in economic models, we often assume that they always prefer more. This helps us to make predictions about how people will behave in different situations."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The **nonsatiation** assumption is used to derive the law of demand.","translation":"非飽和性の仮定は、需要の法則を導き出すために使用される。","type":"definition","meaning_category":"economics"},{"sentence":"Even with a large income, the principle of **nonsatiation** suggests people will still seek to maximize their wealth.","translation":"高収入であっても、非飽和性の原則は、人々が依然として富を最大化しようとすることを示唆している。","type":"example","meaning_category":"economics"}]}

It describes a state where the water body has a high concentration of nutrients, leading to increased plant growth. While this might initially seem beneficial, the subsequent decomposition of this plant matter depletes oxygen levels, harming or killing aquatic animals.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The soil is euthytropic.","correct":"✓ The soil is fertile.","note":"'Euthytropic' is generally reserved for aquatic environments.

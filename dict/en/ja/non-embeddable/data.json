In the context of digital content, it refers to the inability to include content, such as a video or form, directly into another website or document. This is often due to copyright, security, or technical limitations. In mathematics, it has a more technical meaning, referring to objects that cannot be embedded into other objects while preserving certain properties.","priority":"Medium"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"The video is unembeddable.","correct":"The video is non-embeddable.","note":"While 'unembeddable' is sometimes used, 'non-embeddable' is the more common and widely accepted term."}],"priority":"Low"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["embed","embeddable","embedding","non-embedding"],"related_terms":["embedding","isomorphism","manifold","graph theory"]},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low","priority":"Low"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"The word \"non-embeddable\" is a technical term used to describe something that cannot be embedded. Embedding refers to the process of including content from one source into another, such as inserting a video into a webpage. If something is non-embeddable, it means that this process is not possible, usually due to technical or legal restrictions. In mathematics, it describes objects that cannot be mapped into another object while preserving certain properties.

They are often produced by different genes or by alternative splicing of the same gene. Isozymes can be used to identify the tissue of origin of an enzyme in the blood, which can be helpful in diagnosing certain diseases.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ isozyme are","correct":"✓ isozymes are","note":"'isozymes' is a plural noun, so it requires a plural verb form."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["isoenzyme"],"related_terms":["enzyme","catalysis","electrophoresis"]},"level_frequency":{"frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Isozymes' are enzymes that perform the same job in the body but have slight differences in their structure.

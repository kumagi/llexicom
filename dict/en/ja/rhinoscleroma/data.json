It is characterized by the formation of granulomas, which are masses of immune cells, leading to tissue hardening and obstruction. The disease progresses slowly and can cause significant disfigurement if left untreated. Diagnosis typically involves a biopsy and culture to identify the causative organism, Klebsiella rhinoscleromatis.

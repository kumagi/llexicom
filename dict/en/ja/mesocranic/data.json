The cephalic index is calculated as (head breadth / head length) * 100. Mesocranic skulls are considered to be of medium or average proportions, falling between dolichocranic (long and narrow) and brachycranic (short and broad) skull shapes. The term is less commonly used in modern anthropology, as skull shape is now understood to be a complex trait influenced by various genetic and environmental factors, and is not a reliable indicator of race or ancestry.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The head was mesocranic, so it was very long.","correct":"✓ The head was mesocranic, meaning it had a medium length-to-breadth ratio.","note":"Mesocranic does not mean 'very long'; it means having a medium ratio of head breadth to head length."}],"priority":"★☆☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["mesocephaly (noun): the condition of having a mesocranic head shape"],"related_terms":["cephalic index","dolichocranic","brachycranic","anthropometry","skull shape"]},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"N/A (Specialized vocabulary)","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency (scientific/technical context)","priority":"☆☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C2","text":"'Mesocranic' is a technical term used in the field of anthropometry, specifically to describe a skull with a cephalic index within a certain range, indicating a medium or average head shape.

'Shiver' comes from Middle English 'chivere', of Germanic origin, related to Dutch 'scheveren' meaning 'to splinter, shiver'. The 'be-' prefix adds the sense of being completely covered or affected by shivering.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/bɪˈʃɪvərd/","syllables":"be-shiv-ered"},"inflection":{"verb_forms":{"present_simple":["beshiver"],"past_simple":"beshivered","past_participle":"beshivered","present_participle":"beshivering"}},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Beshivered' is an archaic or literary term, rarely used in modern English. It suggests a more intense or pervasive shivering than simply 'shivered'. The 'be-' prefix implies that the subject is completely overcome by the shivering sensation.

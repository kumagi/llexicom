It describes actions, environments, or individuals that promote a sense of choice, independence, and self-direction in others.

It describes a way of interacting with others that encourages their sense of independence and choice. It's important to understand the underlying concept of 'autonomy,' which refers to self-governance or the ability to make one's own decisions. When someone is 'autonomy-supportive,' they are actively creating an environment or relationship where others feel empowered to make their own choices and pursue their own goals. This is different from simply being 'supportive,' which can encompass a broader range of assistance without necessarily focusing on independence."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The therapist used an **autonomy-supportive** approach to help the client identify their own goals.","translation":"セラピストは、クライアントが自分の目標を特定するのを助けるために、自律性を支援するアプローチを使用しました。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"自律性を支援する"},{"sentence":"Providing students with choices is a key element of **autonomy-supportive** teaching.","translation":"生徒に選択肢を提供することは、自律性を支援する教育の重要な要素です。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"自律性を支援する"},{"sentence":"An **autonomy-supportive** manager empowers employees to take ownership of their work.","translation":"自律性を支援するマネージャーは、従業員が自分の仕事のオーナーシップを取ることを奨励します。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"自律性を支援する"},{"sentence":"The study examined the effects of **autonomy-supportive** interventions on student motivation.","translation":"その研究では、学生のモチベーションに対する自律性を支援する介入の効果を調べました。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"自律性を支援する"}]}

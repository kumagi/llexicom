Permeability refers to the ability of a material to allow fluids (usually water) to pass through it. The permeameter is crucial in geotechnical engineering, hydrogeology, and environmental science for assessing soil drainage, groundwater flow, and the suitability of materials for construction or waste disposal. There are two main types: constant head permeameters (where the water pressure remains constant) and falling head permeameters (where the water pressure decreases over time).","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The permeameter measures the strength of the soil.","correct":"✓ The permeameter measures the permeability of the soil.","note":"A permeameter measures permeability, not strength.

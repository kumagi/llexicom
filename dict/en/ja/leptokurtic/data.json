A leptokurtic distribution is one that has a higher peak and fatter tails than a normal distribution. This means that the data is more concentrated around the mean (the average value) and there are more extreme values (outliers). Understanding this term requires a background in statistics. It's the opposite of 'platykurtic', which describes a flatter distribution.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The returns on this investment exhibit a leptokurtic distribution, indicating higher risk.","translation":"この投資の収益はレプトクルティックな分布を示しており、リスクが高いことを示唆しています。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"statistics"},{"sentence":"We observed a leptokurtic pattern in the frequency of earthquakes in the region.","translation":"その地域における地震の頻度にレプトクルティックなパターンが観察されました。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"statistics"},{"sentence":"The leptokurtic nature of the data suggests a potential for extreme events.","translation":"データのレプトクルティックな性質は、極端な事象の可能性を示唆しています。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"statistics"}]}

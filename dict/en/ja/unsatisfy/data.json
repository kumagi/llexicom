It's not a very common word; usually, we say 'disappoint' or 'fail to satisfy' instead. For example, 'The food unsatisfied him' means the food didn't make him feel full or happy. It's important to remember that 'unsatisfy' needs someone to be unsatisfied, so you can't just say 'The movie unsatisfied' without saying who it unsatisfied. The adjective forms 'unsatisfied' (feeling unsatisfied) and 'unsatisfying' (causing dissatisfaction) are more commonly used."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The service at the restaurant unsatisfied the customers.","translation":"そのレストランのサービスは顧客を不満にさせた。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"不満にさせる"},{"sentence":"The lack of rain unsatisfied the farmers.","translation":"雨不足は農家を不満にさせた。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"不満にさせる"},{"sentence":"The explanation unsatisfied her curiosity.","translation":"その説明は彼女の好奇心を満たさなかった。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"不満にさせる"}]}

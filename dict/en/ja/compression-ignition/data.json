The air is compressed to a high degree, which raises its temperature, and then fuel is injected, causing it to ignite spontaneously due to the heat.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/kəmˌprɛʃən ɪɡˈnɪʃən/","syllables":"com-pres-sion ig-ni-tion"},"inflection":{},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Compression-ignition' is almost exclusively used to describe engines, particularly diesel engines. The term highlights the key difference between these engines and spark-ignition engines (like gasoline engines), where a spark plug is used to ignite the fuel-air mixture.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The car has a compression ignition.","correct":"✓ The car has a compression-ignition engine.","note":"It's more common to specify that it is a 'compression-ignition engine' rather than just 'compression ignition' when referring to a vehicle."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["compression","ignition","diesel engine","internal combustion engine"],"phrasal_verbs":[],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C1","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"The term 'compression-ignition' is technical and primarily used in the context of engineering and automotive technology.

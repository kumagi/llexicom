Operationalism combines \"operation\" (referring to a process or procedure) with the suffix \"-ism\" (denoting a doctrine or principle). The suffix \"-istic\" is then added to \"operationalism\" to form the adjective.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/ˌɒpərˌeɪʃənəˈlɪstɪk/","syllables":"op-er-a-tion-al-is-tic"},"inflection":{"notes":"This is an adjective, so it does not have plural forms or verb conjugations.

It describes something that adheres to the principles of operationalism, which emphasizes the importance of defining concepts in terms of concrete, measurable operations. This approach aims to avoid ambiguity and ensure that concepts are grounded in empirical reality.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The theory was very operationalistic, making it hard to understand.","correct":"✓ The definition was very operationalistic, making it easy to measure.","note":"Operationalism is about making concepts measurable, not necessarily making theories easier to understand in a general sense.

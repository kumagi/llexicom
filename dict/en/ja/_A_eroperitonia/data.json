While it can sometimes occur after abdominal surgery or certain medical procedures (e.g., peritoneal dialysis), it is most commonly associated with a perforation or rupture of a hollow abdominal organ, such as the stomach, small intestine, or colon. This allows air and intestinal contents to leak into the sterile peritoneal cavity, leading to peritonitis (inflammation of the peritoneum) and potentially sepsis. The condition is usually diagnosed via imaging studies, such as X-rays or CT scans.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The patient has aeroperitonitis.","correct":"✓ The patient has aeroperitonia.","note":"Aeroperitonia refers to the presence of air itself, while peritonitis is the inflammation.

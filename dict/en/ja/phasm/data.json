Its usage is largely confined to literary works, particularly those exploring themes of the supernatural or psychological states. Due to its infrequent occurrence in modern English, it is generally considered a high-level vocabulary word. Understanding its etymological roots in Greek 'phasma' (appearance, phantom) aids in grasping its nuanced meaning. It is important to distinguish it from more common words like 'phantom' or 'illusion', which serve as more accessible synonyms in contemporary language."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The old castle was rumored to be haunted by a malevolent phasm.","translation":"その古い城には悪意のある幻影が出ると噂されていた。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"幻影"},{"sentence":"The politician's promises turned out to be nothing more than a phasm designed to deceive the voters.","translation":"その政治家の約束は、有権者を欺くための単なる見せかけに過ぎないと判明した。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"見せかけ"},{"sentence":"In the dim light, the shadows seemed to coalesce into a terrifying phasm.","translation":"薄暗い光の中で、影が合わさって恐ろしい幻影になったように見えた。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"幻影"}]}

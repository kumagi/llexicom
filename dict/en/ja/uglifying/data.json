It is formed by adding the suffix '-ify' to the adjective 'ugly', which turns it into a verb ('uglify'). The '-ing' ending turns it into a gerund or present participle, which can be used to describe the act of making something ugly. Because it's not a common word, it might be more frequently replaced by phrases like 'making it ugly' or 'deforming it'."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The artist was accused of uglifying the city with his controversial sculpture.","translation":"その芸術家は物議を醸す彫刻で都市を醜くしたと非難された。","type":"verb (present participle)","meaning_category":"醜くすること"},{"sentence":"The uglifying effects of pollution are evident in the discolored buildings.","translation":"汚染の醜くする影響は、変色した建物に明らかである。","type":"adjective (modifying effects)","meaning_category":"醜くする"}]}

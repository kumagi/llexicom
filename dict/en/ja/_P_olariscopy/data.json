Thus, polariscopy literally means 'to view using polarized light.'","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/ˌpoʊləˈrɪskəpi/","syllables":"po-lar-is-co-py"},"inflection":{"noun_plural":"polariscopies"},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"Polariscopy is a specialized microscopy technique that utilizes polarized light to visualize and analyze materials with anisotropic properties, meaning their optical properties vary depending on the direction of light propagation. This technique is particularly useful in identifying crystalline substances, fibers, and other structures that exhibit birefringence (double refraction). It is widely applied in fields such as geology, materials science, and biology.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The doctor used polariscopy to see bacteria.","correct":"✓ The doctor used standard microscopy to see bacteria. / ✓ The doctor used polariscopy to see crystals in the tissue.","note":"Polariscopy is not typically used to visualize bacteria.

'Reconstruct' itself is formed by adding the prefix 're-' (meaning 'again' or 'anew') to the word 'construct' (meaning 'to build or form').

It often implies that the necessary information, materials, or techniques are available to perform the reconstruction. It is commonly used in contexts such as data recovery, historical restoration, and theoretical modeling. The degree to which something is reconstructable can vary, and this is often indicated by adverbs such as 'easily', 'partially', or 'fully'.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The data is reconstructible.","correct":"✓ The data is reconstructable.","note":"While 'reconstructible' is sometimes used, 'reconstructable' is the more common and widely accepted form."},{"incorrect":"✗ The building was reconstructable by the earthquake.","correct":"✓ The building was reconstructable after the earthquake.","note":"'Reconstructable' describes the *potential* for reconstruction, not the cause of the damage.

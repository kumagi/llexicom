It refers to a situation where the voltage in a circuit or device is higher than its specified maximum limit. This can be caused by various factors, such as lightning strikes, power surges, or equipment malfunctions. Overvoltage can damage electronic components and equipment, so it's important to implement protective measures such as surge protectors and voltage regulators. The term is commonly used in technical documents, manuals, and discussions related to electrical systems and safety."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The system is designed to withstand temporary overvoltage conditions.","translation":"そのシステムは一時的な過電圧状態に耐えるように設計されている。","type":"general","meaning_category":"general usage"},{"sentence":"An overvoltage relay is used to detect and respond to excessive voltage levels.","translation":"過電圧リレーは、過剰な電圧レベルを検出して対応するために使用される。","type":"technical","meaning_category":"technical application"},{"sentence":"The solar inverter shut down due to an overvoltage on the grid.","translation":"太陽光インバーターは、グリッドの過電圧のためにシャットダウンした。","type":"application","meaning_category":"specific application"}]}

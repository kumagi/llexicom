It is used to describe the behavior of electrically conductive fluids in the presence of magnetic fields. MHD is applied in various fields, including astrophysics, plasma physics, engineering, and geophysics. The fluid's motion induces electric currents, which in turn generate magnetic fields that interact with the fluid's motion. This interaction leads to complex phenomena such as waves, instabilities, and turbulence.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Magnetohydrodynamic are important for fusion research.","correct":"✓ Magnetohydrodynamics is important for fusion research.","note":"Magnetohydrodynamics is a singular noun, even though it ends in 's'."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["magnetohydrodynamic (adjective)","magnetohydrodynamically (adverb)"],"phrasal_verbs":[],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) is a specialized field that studies how magnetic fields affect electrically conductive fluids like plasmas or liquid metals.

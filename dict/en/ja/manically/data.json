It implies a state of heightened activity and emotion, sometimes associated with the manic phase of bipolar disorder, but can also be used more generally to describe someone who is working or behaving with extreme intensity. The word often carries a negative connotation, suggesting that the behavior is excessive or unsustainable.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ He was manically depressed.","correct":"✓ He was clinically depressed.","note":"'Manically' refers to a state of mania, which is the opposite of depression. While someone with bipolar disorder can experience both mania and depression, they are distinct states. Using 'manically' to describe depression is incorrect. Use 'clinically depressed' or 'severely depressed' instead."},{"incorrect":"✗ She manically cleaned the house because she was bored.","correct":"✓ She frantically cleaned the house because she was bored.","note":"While 'manically' can describe intense activity, it often suggests an underlying emotional or psychological state.

It's often used in science and medicine. For example, if a test has 'non-specificity,' it means it might react to things other than what it's supposed to, leading to incorrect results. It's the opposite of 'specificity,' which means being very precise and targeting only one thing. This word is most often found in scientific papers or discussions.","example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The **non-specificity** of the binding assay made it difficult to interpret the results.","translation":"その結合アッセイの非特異性により、結果の解釈が困難になった。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"lack of specificity"},{"sentence":"Due to the **non-specificity** of the symptoms, the doctor ordered further tests.","translation":"症状の非特異性のため、医師は追加の検査を指示した。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"lack of specificity"},{"sentence":"The **non-specificity** of this approach limits its usefulness in certain applications.","translation":"このアプローチの非特異性により、特定の用途での有用性が制限される。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"lack of specificity"}]}}

It's formed from 'guide,' meaning to show someone the way, and the suffixes '-able' (meaning capable of being) and '-ly' (turning it into an adverb). Use it to describe something that is easy to direct or control. Because it's uncommon, consider whether a more common word like 'controllably' or a phrase like 'with guidance' would be clearer for your audience."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The drone flew guidably along the pre-programmed route.","translation":"ドローンはあらかじめプログラムされたルートに沿って誘導可能に飛行した。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"manner of movement"},{"sentence":"The software allowed the user to guidably adjust the settings.","translation":"そのソフトウェアは、ユーザーが設定を誘導可能に調整することを可能にした。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"manner of adjustment"}]}

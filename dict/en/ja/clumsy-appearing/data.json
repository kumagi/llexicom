It's more descriptive than simply saying something 'is clumsy' because it emphasizes the visual impression. This term is more common in descriptive writing where the appearance is important. It implies that something has an awkward or uncoordinated look. For example, 'The robot had a clumsy-appearing gait' means the robot's walk looked awkward, even if it might have been functional."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The puppet's movements were intentionally clumsy-appearing to create a comedic effect.","translation":"人形の動きは、意図的に不器用に見えるように作られており、コメディ効果を生み出していた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"不器用に見える"},{"sentence":"The old machine had a clumsy-appearing design, but it was surprisingly efficient.","translation":"その古い機械は不器用に見えるデザインだったが、驚くほど効率的だった。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"ぎこちなく見える"}]}

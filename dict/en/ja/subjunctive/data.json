This includes wishes, possibilities, suggestions, and hypothetical situations. It's a more advanced grammar concept, and you'll often see it discussed in the context of English language learning at higher levels. While native speakers may not always consciously use the subjunctive, it's important to recognize it in formal writing and speech.

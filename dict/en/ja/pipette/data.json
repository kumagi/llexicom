They come in different types – some use a bulb you squeeze to draw the liquid up (like a Pasteur pipette), while others are more sophisticated with adjustable volumes.  It's crucial for accuracy in experiments, so they're carefully calibrated. You wouldn’t use one to pour a drink; it’s specifically for controlled lab work."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The scientist used a **pipette** to add exactly 5 milliliters of the solution.","translation":"科学者はピペットを使って、その溶液を正確に5ミリリットル加えた。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"一般的な使用例"},{"sentence":"She carefully calibrated the **pipette** before starting the experiment.","translation":"彼女は実験を開始する前に、ピペットを注意深く校正した。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"校正・精度"},{"sentence":"He used a Pasteur **pipette** to transfer the liquid.","translation":"彼はパスツールピペットを使って液体を移送した。","type":"noun (specific type)","meaning_category":"特定の種類"},{"sentence":"The lab technician filled several **pipettes** with the reagent.","translation":"ラボの技術者は、いくつかのピペットに試薬を充填した。","type":"noun (plural)","meaning_category":"複数形"}]}

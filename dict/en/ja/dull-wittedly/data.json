It's not a common word, so it's more likely to be found in advanced texts or literature where the author wants to specifically emphasize someone's lack of mental sharpness in their actions. It is formed from the adjective 'dull-witted,' which means slow to understand or not very intelligent, and the suffix '-ly,' which turns it into an adverb.

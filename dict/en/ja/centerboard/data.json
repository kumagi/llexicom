When lowered, it provides resistance to the water, preventing the boat from being pushed sideways by the wind. When raised, it reduces drag in deeper water or when approaching a beach.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The sailboat doesn't have a centerboard, it has a keel.","correct":"✓ The sailboat has both a centerboard and a keel. / ✓ The sailboat has a keel, not a centerboard.","note":"Some sailboats have both a fixed keel and a centerboard.

It is not a very common word, so it is more likely to be encountered in advanced texts where precise and evocative language is used. The word combines the concept of being 'tainted' (i.e., impure or corrupted) with the visual aspect of 'looking' a certain way. It is typically used to describe physical objects or abstract concepts like reputation, where the appearance suggests a negative quality."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The milk had a tainted-looking texture and a sour smell.","translation":"その牛乳は汚染されたような質感と酸っぱい匂いがした。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"汚染されたように見える"},{"sentence":"The politician's promises had a tainted-looking sincerity after he was caught lying.","translation":"その政治家の約束は嘘をついたことが発覚した後、堕落した誠実さに見えた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"堕落したように見える"},{"sentence":"The water in the abandoned well was tainted-looking and stagnant.","translation":"廃坑の井戸の水は汚染されたように見え、よどんでいた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"汚染されたように見える"}]}

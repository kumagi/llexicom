This difference in solute concentration creates an osmotic pressure gradient, which can cause water to move out of the less concentrated area (e.g., a cell) into the more concentrated area (the hyperosmotic environment). This can have significant biological effects, such as cell shrinkage or dehydration.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The cell is hyperosmotic.","correct":"✓ The cell is in a hyperosmotic solution. / ✓ The solution is hyperosmotic to the cell.","note":"A cell itself is not hyperosmotic; it is exposed to a hyperosmotic environment or solution.

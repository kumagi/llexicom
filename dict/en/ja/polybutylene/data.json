It was widely used in plumbing systems, particularly in North America, until it was discovered to be prone to degradation when exposed to certain disinfectants in water supplies. This led to widespread lawsuits and the replacement of polybutylene pipes in many homes. While its use in plumbing has declined, it is still used in other applications such as flexible packaging, hot-melt adhesives, and specialized engineering applications.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Polybutylene is a type of metal.","correct":"✓ Polybutylene is a type of plastic.","note":"Polybutylene is a polymer, which is a type of plastic, not a metal."},{"incorrect":"✗ Polybutylene pipes are still the best choice for new plumbing installations.","correct":"✓ Polybutylene pipes are generally not recommended for new plumbing installations due to their history of failures.","note":"Due to the issues with degradation and past lawsuits, polybutylene pipes are generally avoided in new installations."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["polybutene","polymer","thermoplastic"],"phrasal_verbs":[],"priority":"★☆☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"低頻度 (Low frequency) - 技術的な文脈でのみ使用される専門用語。","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Polybutylene' is a technical term referring to a specific type of plastic polymer.

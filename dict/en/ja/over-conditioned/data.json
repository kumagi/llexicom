Techniques like regularization, cross-validation, and early stopping are used to prevent models from becoming over-conditioned.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The data is over-conditioned.","correct":"✓ The model is over-conditioned.","note":"'Over-conditioned' describes the model, not the data itself.

It describes a model that has learned the training data too well, including its noise and irrelevant details, leading to poor performance on new data. Think of it like studying for a test by memorizing the exact questions and answers; you'll do well on that specific test, but you won't be able to answer new questions on the same topic.

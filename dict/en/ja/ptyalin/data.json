It begins the process of breaking down complex carbohydrates (starches) into simpler sugars like maltose as food is chewed. While often used interchangeably with 'salivary amylase,' ptyalin is the more historical term. Its activity is optimal at a neutral to slightly alkaline pH, which is typically found in the mouth.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Ptyalin digests proteins.","correct":"✓ Ptyalin digests carbohydrates.","note":"Ptyalin specifically targets carbohydrates, not proteins."},{"incorrect":"✗ Ptyalin is produced in the stomach.","correct":"✓ Ptyalin is produced in the salivary glands.","note":"Ptyalin is produced in the salivary glands and released into the mouth, not the stomach."}],"priority":"★☆☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["amylase","saliva","carbohydrate","digestion","hydrolysis"],"phrasal_verbs":[],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Ptyalin' is a technical term primarily used in the context of biology, biochemistry, and medicine when discussing the enzymatic digestion of carbohydrates.

It describes the process by which a system reaches thermal equilibrium, meaning that energy is distributed evenly among its components, and the system's macroscopic properties (like temperature) become uniform. The term is often used in discussions of complex systems, such as gases, solids, or even more exotic systems like quark-gluon plasmas.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The food thermalizes in the oven.","correct":"✓ The food heats up in the oven.","note":"'Thermalizes' is a precise scientific term.

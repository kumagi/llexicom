It is often used in scientific or technical contexts, such as discussing the spread of diseases (infectious diseases) or the properties of materials (e.g., how well they transmit light or sound). The specific meaning depends on the context. For example, in epidemiology, it relates to how easily a pathogen spreads from one host to another. In optics, it describes how much light passes through a material.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The transmissiveness is very important for the virus.","correct":"✓ The transmissiveness of the virus is very important.","note":"It's better to specify what possesses the transmissiveness.

It's often used in science or medicine. For example, you might hear about the transmissiveness of a virus, which means how easily the virus spreads from person to person. Or, you might talk about the transmissiveness of a material, which means how well light or sound can pass through it.

Understanding this term requires familiarity with basic biological concepts such as autotrophy and energy sources for organisms. The word breaks down into components derived from Greek roots, indicating its meaning: 'litho-' (stone/rock), 'auto-' (self), and 'trophic' (nourishment). Therefore, a lithoautotrophic organism is one that 'self-nourishes' using energy derived from inorganic compounds (often found in rocks or minerals) rather than organic matter or sunlight. This mode of nutrition is crucial for understanding life in extreme environments and the cycling of elements in the Earth's ecosystems."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The discovery of lithoautotrophic bacteria in deep-sea hydrothermal vents revolutionized our understanding of life's potential on Earth.","translation":"深海熱水噴出孔における岩石無機栄養細菌の発見は、地球上の生命の可能性に関する我々の理解に革命をもたらした。","type":"general","meaning_category":"general"},{"sentence":"Lithoautotrophic microorganisms play a key role in the oxidation of iron and sulfur in acid mine drainage.","translation":"岩石無機栄養微生物は、酸性鉱山排水中の鉄と硫黄の酸化において重要な役割を果たす。","type":"specific","meaning_category":"specific"}]}

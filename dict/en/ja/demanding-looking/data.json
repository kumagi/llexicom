It combines the meaning of 'demanding' (requiring much effort) with 'looking' (having a certain appearance). It is less common than simply saying something 'looks demanding' or 'seems demanding,' but it provides a more concise way to express the idea that something's appearance suggests it will be difficult or require significant effort. Because it's a more nuanced and less common term, it's more appropriate for advanced learners."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The demanding-looking exam papers made the students anxious.","translation":"その要求の多そうな見た目の試験用紙は、学生たちを不安にさせた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"appearance"},{"sentence":"She hesitated before accepting the demanding-looking assignment.","translation":"彼女は、要求の多そうな見た目の課題を受け入れる前に躊躇した。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"appearance"},{"sentence":"The demanding-looking legal document required careful review.","translation":"その要求の多そうな見た目の法的文書は、注意深い見直しを必要とした。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"appearance"}]}

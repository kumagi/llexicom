'Ion' was coined by the English scientist Michael Faraday in the 19th century from the Greek word 'ion' (ἰόν), meaning 'going' or 'moving'. This refers to the movement of ions in an electrolyte. The suffix '-ise' (or '-ize') is used to form verbs indicating the act of making or becoming something.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"ˈaɪənaɪzd","syllables":"I-on-ised"},"inflection":{"verb_forms":{"present_simple":["ionise","ionises"],"past_simple":"ionised","present_participle":"ionising"}},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Ionised' is the past participle form of the verb 'ionise'.

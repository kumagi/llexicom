It can also describe the physical characteristic of a place that is remote and isolated.

'Loneliness' usually implies a feeling of sadness due to being alone, whereas 'solitariness' can be a chosen state.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"He was feeling solitariness.","correct":"He was feeling lonely. / He was experiencing solitariness.","note":"'Solitariness' is a state or condition, not a feeling itself.

It refers to the state of being alone, often implying a chosen or appreciated state of being separate from others. It can also refer to the physical remoteness of a place. Because it's less common and more nuanced than its synonyms, it's typically encountered in more advanced texts or discussions about psychology, philosophy, or nature writing. Understanding the difference between 'solitariness' and 'loneliness' is key to using the word correctly; 'solitariness' doesn't necessarily imply negative feelings."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The artist sought the **solitariness** of the desert to inspire his work.","translation":"その芸術家は作品のインスピレーションを得るために砂漠の孤独を求めた。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"state of being alone"},{"sentence":"She valued the **solitariness** that her early morning walks provided.","translation":"彼女は早朝の散歩がもたらす孤独を大切にしていた。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"state of being alone"},{"sentence":"The **solitariness** of the remote cabin was both a blessing and a curse.","translation":"その人里離れた小屋の孤独は、祝福でもあり呪いでもあった。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"remoteness of a place"},{"sentence":"He found peace in the **solitariness** of the mountains.","translation":"彼は山々の孤独の中に平和を見出した。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"state of being alone"},{"sentence":"The **solitariness** of her existence began to weigh on her.","translation":"彼女の孤独な生活は彼女の重荷になり始めた。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"state of being alone"}]}

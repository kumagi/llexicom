It is unique because it originates on the femur (thigh bone) and inserts on the tibia (shin bone). Its primary function is to unlock the knee joint from its fully extended position, allowing for flexion. It also contributes to internal rotation of the tibia and provides stability to the knee joint, particularly against excessive external rotation. Injuries to the popliteus are relatively uncommon but can occur due to trauma or overuse.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ popliteous","correct":"✓ popliteus","note":"The correct spelling is 'popliteus', not 'popliteous'."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["popliteal (adjective: relating to the popliteus or the area behind the knee)","popliteal fossa (noun: the hollow at the back of the knee)"],"phrasal_verbs":[]},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"N/A (specialized medical term)","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency (専門用語)","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C2","text":"'Popliteus' is a specialized anatomical term referring to a specific muscle located behind the knee.

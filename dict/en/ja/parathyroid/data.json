These glands are responsible for secreting parathyroid hormone (PTH), which regulates calcium levels in the blood. Understanding the function and potential disorders of the parathyroid glands requires a background in human anatomy and endocrine physiology. Conditions like hyperparathyroidism and hypoparathyroidism can significantly impact calcium homeostasis, leading to various health complications.

'Benefit' comes from the Old French word 'benfet', meaning 'good deed', which in turn comes from the Latin words 'bene' (well) and 'facere' (to do). The double 't' in 'benefitted' is due to the British English spelling rule of doubling the final consonant when adding a suffix to a word ending in a single vowel followed by a single consonant, especially when the stress is on the syllable before the final consonant.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/ˈbɛnɪfɪtɪd/","syllables":"ben-e-fit-ted"},"inflection":{"verb_forms":{"present_simple":["benefit","benefits"],"past_simple":"benefitted","past_participle":"benefitted","present_participle":"benefitting"}},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Benefitted' is the past tense and past participle form of the verb 'benefit'.

It is used to describe something that is not entirely safe but not extremely dangerous either. Because it is a more nuanced term, it is more commonly found in writing or speech that requires a higher level of precision. The prefix 'semi-' indicates that the level of danger is partial or moderate, not complete. Understanding this prefix helps in grasping the meaning of the word."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"Climbing that hill without proper equipment is semidangerous.","translation":"適切な装備なしでその丘を登るのはいくらか危険だ。","type":"general","meaning_category":"general"},{"sentence":"The abandoned building was semidangerous due to structural issues.","translation":"その廃墟は構造上の問題のためいくらか危険だった。","type":"specific","meaning_category":"specific"}]}

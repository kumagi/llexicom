'Congeal' comes from Latin 'congelare' (to freeze together), from 'com-' (together) + 'gelare' (to freeze). '-ability' is a suffix denoting capability or the quality of being able to do something.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/kənˌdʒiːləˈbɪləti/","syllables":"con-geal-a-bil-i-ty"},"inflection":{"noun_plural":"congealabilities"},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Congealability' specifically refers to the potential or capacity of a substance to transform from a liquid or semi-liquid state into a solid or semi-solid state.

A substance doesn't 'have' congealability in the same way it 'is' liquid. Instead, a substance 'has' high or low congealability.

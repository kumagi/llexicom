It is used to describe speeds approaching the speed of light, strong gravitational fields, and other situations where classical approximations break down. The term implies that the effects of special or general relativity must be taken into account for accurate calculations or descriptions.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The car was traveling at relativistic speed.","correct":"✓ The car was traveling at a relativistic speed.","note":"When referring to a speed, it's common to use the indefinite article 'a' before 'relativistic speed' because it's one instance of such a speed, not a specific, named speed.

It describes the characteristic of a mathematical space or set that does not possess the property of compactness. Compactness, in simple terms, means that any collection of open sets that covers the space (an open cover) has a finite subcollection that also covers the space. If a space lacks this property, it is said to exhibit 'non-compactness.' This concept is crucial for understanding the behavior of functions and spaces in higher-level mathematics."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The proof relies heavily on the non-compactness of the domain.","translation":"その証明は、領域の非コンパクト性に大きく依存している。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"general"},{"sentence":"The function behaves differently due to the non-compactness of the interval.","translation":"その関数は、区間の非コンパクト性のため、異なる挙動を示す。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"topology"}]}

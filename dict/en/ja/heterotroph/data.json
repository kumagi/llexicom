This contrasts with autotrophs, which can produce their own food using sunlight (photosynthesis) or chemical energy (chemosynthesis). Heterotrophs include all animals, fungi, and many bacteria. They play a crucial role in ecosystems by consuming and decomposing organic matter, thus recycling nutrients.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Heterotrophs produce their own food using photosynthesis.","correct":"✓ Autotrophs produce their own food using photosynthesis.","note":"Heterotrophs cannot produce their own food; autotrophs do.

It is typically encountered in higher-level biology courses or scientific literature. Understanding this term requires some background knowledge in biology, particularly in the areas of ecology and nutrition. It's important to distinguish heterotrophs from autotrophs, which produce their own food.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"All animals, including humans, are **heterotrophs** and rely on consuming other organisms for energy.","translation":"人間を含むすべての動物は**従属栄養生物**であり、エネルギーを得るために他の生物を消費することに頼っています。","type":"general","meaning_category":"definition"},{"sentence":"**Heterotrophs** play a vital role in ecosystems by consuming and decomposing organic material.","translation":"**従属栄養生物**は、有機物を消費および分解することにより、生態系において重要な役割を果たします。","type":"ecological role","meaning_category":"definition"},{"sentence":"The study examined the diversity of **heterotrophic** bacteria in the soil.","translation":"その研究では、土壌中の**従属栄養**細菌の多様性を調査しました。","type":"example with derivative","meaning_category":"related term"},{"sentence":"Fungi are **heterotrophs** that secrete enzymes to break down complex organic compounds.","translation":"菌類は、複雑な有機化合物を分解するために酵素を分泌する**従属栄養生物**です。","type":"example with fungi","meaning_category":"definition"}]}

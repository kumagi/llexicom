It's formed by combining 'bendable' (capable of being bent) and 'looking' (having a particular appearance). This term is used when you want to convey that something has the visual characteristic of being bendable, even if you haven't tested its actual flexibility. It's more descriptive than simply saying something is 'bendable', as it focuses on the appearance.

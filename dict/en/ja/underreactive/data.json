It can apply to various contexts, including medical, psychological, and chemical. In medicine, it refers to a diminished response to stimuli like pain or reflexes. In a broader sense, it can describe a lack of emotional or behavioral response. In chemistry, it signifies a substance's low tendency to undergo chemical reactions.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The chemical was very underreactive.","correct":"✓ The chemical was quite underreactive.","note":"\"Very\" is less common with \"underreactive\" as it implies a complete lack of reaction, which is better described by \"inert\" or \"nonreactive\". \"Quite\" or \"somewhat\" are more appropriate to indicate a reduced level of reactivity."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["underreact (verb)","underreaction (noun)"],"phrasal_verbs":[],"related_terms":["reactivity","overreactive","hyporeactivity"]},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"\"Underreactive\" is a technical term used to describe something that doesn't respond as strongly as expected.

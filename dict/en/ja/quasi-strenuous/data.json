It combines the prefix \"quasi-\" which means \"resembling\" or \"somewhat\" with the adjective \"strenuous\", which means requiring significant effort or energy. This term is useful in contexts where a more precise description is needed to indicate that an activity or effort is not completely easy but also not extremely demanding.

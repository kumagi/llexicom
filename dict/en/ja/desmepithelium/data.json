Understanding this term requires a strong background in biology and medicine. It refers to a specific type of epithelial tissue characterized by numerous desmosomes, which are cell-to-cell adhesion structures. Its usage is almost exclusively within the context of diagnosing and describing certain types of ovarian tumors.

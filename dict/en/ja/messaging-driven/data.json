Imagine sending a letter instead of calling someone directly. The sender doesn't wait for an immediate reply. This allows different parts of the system to work independently, making it more flexible and able to handle more tasks at the same time. It's often used when building complex applications that are spread across multiple computers.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The new e-commerce platform is entirely messaging-driven, allowing for seamless integration of various services.","translation":"新しいeコマースプラットフォームは完全にメッセージング駆動型であり、さまざまなサービスのシームレスな統合を可能にしています。","type":"general","meaning_category":"architecture"},{"sentence":"A messaging-driven approach enables better fault tolerance, as services can continue operating even if others are temporarily unavailable.","translation":"メッセージング駆動型のアプローチにより、サービスが一時的に利用できなくても動作を継続できるため、より優れたフォールトトレランスが可能になります。","type":"technical","meaning_category":"benefits"},{"sentence":"Implementing a messaging-driven solution requires careful consideration of message formats and queuing mechanisms.","translation":"メッセージング駆動型のソリューションを実装するには、メッセージ形式とキューイングメカニズムを慎重に検討する必要があります。","type":"implementation","meaning_category":"considerations"}]}

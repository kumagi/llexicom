It's not as common as 'walks', which is the usual plural of 'walk' (meaning a stroll or journey on foot). 'Walkings' is mostly used to talk about different places or routes where you can go for a walk. Think of it like saying 'hiking trails' but using 'walkings' instead. It's more formal and less frequently used in everyday conversation. When you see 'walking' (without the 's'), it's usually describing the action of walking, like 'I enjoy walking in the park'."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The map showed several scenic walkings in the hills.","translation":"地図には丘陵地帯のいくつかの景色の良い散歩道が示されていた。","type":"noun (plural)","meaning_category":"areas for walking"},{"sentence":"She is walkings her dog in the park.","translation":"彼女は公園で犬を散歩させている。","type":"verb (present participle)","meaning_category":"act of walking"},{"sentence":"The brochure highlighted the best walkings in the region.","translation":"パンフレットにはその地域で最高の散歩道が紹介されていた。","type":"noun (plural)","meaning_category":"areas for walking"},{"sentence":"They were walkings along the riverbank, enjoying the peaceful scenery.","translation":"彼らは川岸を歩きながら、穏やかな景色を楽しんでいた。","type":"verb (present participle)","meaning_category":"act of walking"}]}

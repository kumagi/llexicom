Because of its specific usage, it is not commonly encountered in everyday language. Understanding the word requires familiarity with the concept of a 'slab' and the function of the '-like' suffix to denote resemblance. Its use is generally limited to contexts where precise description of shape and form is important."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The geologist examined the slablike layers of sedimentary rock.","translation":"地質学者は、堆積岩の厚板状の層を調べた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"形状"},{"sentence":"The modern building featured slablike sections of glass and steel.","translation":"その近代的な建物は、ガラスと鋼鉄の厚板状のセクションを特徴としていた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"構造"}]}

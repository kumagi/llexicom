It is formed by adding the prefix 'un-' (meaning 'not') to 'miasmatical,' which itself is derived from 'miasma.' 'Miasma' refers to a now-discredited theory that diseases were caused by 'bad air' or noxious fumes. Therefore, 'unmiasmatical' describes something that is free from this 'bad air' or these harmful influences. Because of its historical and scientific context, this word is unlikely to be encountered in everyday language and is more likely to appear in historical or scientific texts discussing the miasma theory of disease."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The doctor insisted on the importance of an unmiasmatical environment for the patients' recovery.","translation":"医師は、患者の回復のために瘴気のない環境が重要であることを主張した。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"free from miasma"},{"sentence":"They sought an unmiasmatical location for their new home, far from the polluted city.","translation":"彼らは汚染された都市から遠く離れた、瘴気のない場所を新しい家のために探した。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"pure and clean"}]}

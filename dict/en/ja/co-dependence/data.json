It initially described the relationship dynamics observed between alcoholics and their spouses or family members. The 'co-' prefix signifies that the dependence is shared or reciprocal, with the non-addict's behavior often enabling or perpetuating the addict's behavior. Over time, the concept expanded to encompass a broader range of dysfunctional relationships beyond addiction.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/ˌkoʊdɪˈpɛndəns/","syllables":"co-de-pen-dence"},"inflection":{"noun_plural":null},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"Co-dependence is characterized by an excessive emotional or psychological reliance on another person, often someone who suffers from an addiction or other form of mental or physical illness. The co-dependent individual may prioritize the needs of the other person above their own, leading to a neglect of their own well-being and a difficulty in setting healthy boundaries. While the term initially focused on relationships involving addiction, it is now used more broadly to describe any relationship where one person's needs are consistently subordinated to those of another, and where there is a pattern of enabling or controlling behavior. It's important to note that co-dependence is not a formal diagnosis in the DSM (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders).","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ She is co-dependent with her work.","correct":"✓ She has a co-dependent relationship with her work.","note":"Co-dependence describes a relationship between people, not a relationship with an object or activity.

Imagine a dial that can stop at specific numbers instead of moving smoothly between them. This term is often used in computer science and data analysis, where continuous data (like temperature readings) is converted into discrete categories (like 'cold,' 'warm,' 'hot') for easier processing. Understanding this term is helpful when dealing with data manipulation and algorithm design in technical fields."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The **discretization** of sensor data improved the efficiency of the control system.","translation":"センサーデータの離散化により、制御システムの効率が向上しました。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"離散化"},{"sentence":"Careful **discretization** is essential for effective use of decision tree algorithms.","translation":"決定木アルゴリズムを効果的に使用するには、慎重な離散化が不可欠です。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"離散化"}]}

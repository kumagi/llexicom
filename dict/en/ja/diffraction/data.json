It is most prominent when the wavelength of the wave is comparable to or larger than the size of the obstacle or aperture. This causes the wave to bend around the obstacle or spread out after passing through the aperture, creating interference patterns.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The diffraction caused the light to reflect.","correct":"✓ The diffraction caused the light to bend.","note":"Diffraction involves bending or spreading, not reflection.

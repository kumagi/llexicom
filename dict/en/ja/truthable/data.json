It describes something, usually a statement or proposition, that is capable of being either true or false. In other words, it's something that can have a truth value. This term is not commonly used in everyday conversation and is more likely to be encountered in academic or specialized contexts. It's important to distinguish it from related concepts like \"truth\" and \"verifiability,\" as it specifically refers to the capacity to possess a truth value, not necessarily the actual determination of that value."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"Only declarative sentences are considered truthable in formal logic.","translation":"形式論理では、宣言文のみが真理値を持つとみなされる。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"論理学"},{"sentence":"The question of whether moral claims are truthable is a central debate in metaethics.","translation":"道徳的主張が真理値を持つことができるかどうかという問題は、メタ倫理の中心的な議論である。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"論理学"},{"sentence":"A truthable proposition can be either affirmed or denied.","translation":"真理値を持つ命題は、肯定または否定することができる。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"論理学"}]}

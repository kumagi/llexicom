It describes the process by which a skull becomes shorter and wider relative to its length, a characteristic known as brachycephaly. This term is rarely encountered outside of scientific literature or discussions pertaining to animal morphology, particularly in the context of dog and cat breeds. Understanding this term requires a solid foundation in biological terminology and an awareness of skull morphology.

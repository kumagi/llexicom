Quam diu etiam furor iste tuus eludet? Quem ad finem sese effrenata iactabit audacia? Nihilne te nocturnum praesidium Palatii, nihil urbis vigiliae, nihil timor populi, nihil concursus bonorum omnium, nihil hic munitissimus habendi senatus locus, nihil horum ora vultusque moverunt? Patere tua consilia non sentis? Constrictam iam horum omnium scientia teneri coniurationem tuam non vides? Quid proxima, quid superiore nocte egeris, ubi fueris, quos convocaveris, quid consili ceperis, quem nostrum ignorare arbitraris? O tempora, o mores! Senatus haec intellegit, consul videt; hic tamen vivit. Vivit? Immo vero etiam in senatum venit, fit publici consili particeps, notat et designat oculis ad caedem unum quemque nostrum. Nos autem, fortes viri, satis facere rei publicae videmur, si istius furorem ac tela vitemus. Ad mortem te, Catilina, duci iussu consulis iam pridem oportebat, in te conferri pestem, quam tu in omnis iam pridem machinaris.'","translation":"(Cicero, Against Catiline): 'How long, Catiline, will you abuse our patience? How long will that madness of yours mock us? To what end will your unbridled audacity hurl itself? Does the nightly guard of the Palatine, do the city watchmen, does the fear of the people, does the assembly of all good men, does this most fortified place for the holding of the Senate, do the faces and expressions of these men move you not at all? Do you not feel that your plans are exposed? Do you not see that your conspiracy is already held constrained by the knowledge of all these men? What you did last night, what you did the night before, where you were, whom you summoned, what plan you adopted, whom of us do you think is ignorant? O the times! O the morals! The Senate understands these things, the consul sees them; yet this man lives. Lives? Nay, truly, he even comes into the Senate, he takes part in the public council, he marks and designates with his eyes each one of us for slaughter. But we, brave men, seem to do enough for the republic if we avoid the madness and the weapons of that man. You ought, Catiline, long ago to have been led to death by the order of the consul, the destruction which you have long been plotting against all of us ought to have been brought upon you.'","type":"noun","meaning_category":"freedom, permission, privilege, licentiousness, wantonness"}]}

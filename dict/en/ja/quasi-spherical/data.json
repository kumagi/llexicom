It is commonly found in scientific and mathematical contexts. The prefix 'quasi-' indicates approximation or resemblance, so 'quasi-spherical' implies a shape that is close to a sphere but has some irregularities or deviations. This term is more precise than simply saying 'round' but less strict than 'spherical'. Understanding the meaning of 'quasi-' is key to understanding this word.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The droplets of liquid nitrogen formed quasi-spherical shapes due to surface tension.","translation":"液体窒素の液滴は、表面張力により準球形を形成した。","type":"descriptive","meaning_category":"shape"},{"sentence":"Astronomers classified the newly discovered moon as a quasi-spherical body.","translation":"天文学者たちは、新しく発見された衛星を準球形の天体として分類した。","type":"scientific","meaning_category":"classification"},{"sentence":"The experimental reactor used quasi-spherical fuel pellets to maximize surface area.","translation":"その実験用原子炉は、表面積を最大化するために準球形の燃料ペレットを使用した。","type":"technical","meaning_category":"application"}]}

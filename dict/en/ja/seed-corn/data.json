'Seed' refers to the grains or seeds used for planting, and 'corn' is a general term for grain, especially in British English.

Literally, it refers to grain that is kept specifically for planting in the future, rather than being eaten.

Understanding the metaphorical use requires a grasp of the underlying concept of delayed gratification and investment for future returns. The term is more common in formal writing and discussions about economics or business strategy."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The government allocated funds as seed-corn for the development of renewable energy technologies.","translation":"政府は再生可能エネルギー技術の開発のための元手として資金を割り当てた。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"investment"},{"sentence":"The farmer made sure to keep enough seed-corn to plant the fields next spring.","translation":"農夫は来年の春に畑を耕作するのに十分な種籾を確保した。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"agriculture"},{"sentence":"Investing in employee training is like planting seed-corn for the future success of the company.","translation":"従業員研修への投資は、会社の将来の成功のために種籾を植えるようなものだ。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"investment"},{"sentence":"The villagers depended on the seed-corn to ensure a harvest in the coming year.","translation":"村人たちは来年の収穫を確実にするために種籾に頼っていた。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"agriculture"}]}

This term originated from the historical practice of coercing individuals, often through deception or kidnapping, to work on ships bound for Shanghai, China, during the 19th century. While the literal practice is rare today, the word is sometimes used figuratively to describe any situation where someone is manipulated or forced into an undesirable position or activity. Due to its historical context and specific meaning, it is not a commonly used word in everyday conversation."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The old sailor claimed he had been **shanghaied** as a young man.","translation":"その老船員は、若い頃にだまされて船に乗せられたと主張した。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"だまして船に乗せる"},{"sentence":"He felt like he had been **shanghaied** into joining the committee.","translation":"彼は委員会への参加をだまされたように感じた。","type":"verb (figurative)","meaning_category":"だまして不本意な状況に陥らせる"}]}

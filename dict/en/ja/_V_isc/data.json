It describes the internal friction of a moving fluid. A fluid with high viscosity resists movement because its molecular makeup gives it a lot of internal friction. A fluid with low viscosity flows easily because its molecular makeup results in very little friction when it is moving.","examples":[{"sentence":"The visc of the oil was too high for the engine to run efficiently.","translation":"そのオイルの粘度が高すぎて、エンジンが効率的に作動しなかった。"}],"collocations":[],"synonyms":["viscosity"],"antonyms":[]}],"etymology":{"value":"Abbreviation of viscosity.","priority":"★★★"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/vɪsk/","syllables":"Visc"},"inflection":{},"usage_notes":{},"common_mistakes":{},"related_words":{"derivatives":["viscosity","viscous"],"phrasal_verbs":[]},"level_frequency":{},"readability_explanation":{},"example_sentences":[]}

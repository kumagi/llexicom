It refers to a rock unit that has been displaced a significant distance from its original site of formation. This displacement is typically caused by thrust faulting, where one rock mass is pushed over another. The term is often used interchangeably with 'allochthon', although some geologists make subtle distinctions based on the scale or mechanism of transport.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The heterochthon was formed in situ.","correct":"✓ The heterochthon was transported to its current location.","note":"Heterochthons, by definition, are not formed in their current location; they are transported."}],"priority":"★☆☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":[],"related_terms":["allochthon","autochthon","nappe","thrust fault","tectonics"],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"frequency_google_ngram":"Very low frequency - primarily used in specialized geological contexts.","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C2","text":"'Heterochthon' is a technical term used in geology to describe a large mass of rock that has been moved from its original location, usually by tectonic forces.

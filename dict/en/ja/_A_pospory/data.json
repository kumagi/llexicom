It involves the development of a gametophyte (the structure that produces gametes) directly from the sporophyte (the diploid, spore-producing phase) without the usual process of meiosis (reduction division). This results in a gametophyte with the same chromosome number as the sporophyte. Apospory can be obligate (always occurring) or facultative (occurring sometimes).","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Apospory is the same as sexual reproduction.","correct":"✓ Apospory is a type of asexual reproduction.","note":"Apospory is a form of asexual reproduction, not sexual reproduction."},{"incorrect":"✗ Apospory involves meiosis.","correct":"✓ Apospory bypasses meiosis.","note":"Apospory is characterized by the absence of meiosis."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["apomixis","sporophyte","gametophyte","meiosis"],"phrasal_verbs":[],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"低頻度 (Low frequency) - 植物学の専門用語。","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"Apospory is a technical term in botany that describes a specific type of asexual reproduction in plants. It refers to the development of a gametophyte directly from the sporophyte without the usual process of meiosis. This results in offspring that are genetically identical to the parent plant.

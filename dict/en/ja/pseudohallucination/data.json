They understand that the image, sound, or other sensation originates in their own mind, not from an external source. It's like a very strong daydream or mental image that you know isn't actually happening. This awareness distinguishes it from a true hallucination, where the person believes the experience is real."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The artist often experienced pseudohallucinations, which inspired his surreal paintings.","translation":"その芸術家はしばしば仮性幻覚を経験し、それが彼のシュールな絵画に影響を与えた。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"仮性幻覚"},{"sentence":"During meditation, she sometimes had visual pseudohallucinations, seeing patterns and colors behind her closed eyelids.","translation":"瞑想中、彼女は時々視覚的な仮性幻覚を経験し、閉じられたまぶたの裏にパターンや色を見た。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"仮性幻覚"},{"sentence":"The doctor carefully differentiated between the patient's pseudohallucinations and true psychotic hallucinations.","translation":"医師は患者の仮性幻覚と真の精神病性幻覚を注意深く区別した。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"仮性幻覚"}]}

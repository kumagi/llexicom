'Comply' originates from the Italian word 'complire,' meaning 'to fulfill, accomplish,' which in turn comes from the Latin word 'complere,' meaning 'to fill up, complete.'

It suggests a passive acceptance and a lack of resistance. The word is often used to describe behavior that is seen as positive, especially in situations where obedience is valued. However, it can also have negative connotations if the compliance is seen as excessive or unthinking.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ He acted compliance.","correct":"✓ He acted compliantly.","note":"'Compliance' is a noun, while 'compliantly' is an adverb.

It's an adverb, so it describes how an action is performed. It's not a very common word, so it's more likely to be used in formal writing or speech. You might see it in legal or business contexts where following rules is very important. It's related to the words 'comply' and 'compliance,' which are also used in similar situations."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The suspect answered the detective's questions compliantly.","translation":"容疑者は刑事の質問に素直に答えた。","type":"general","meaning_category":"従順に"},{"sentence":"The software was designed to work compliantly with existing systems.","translation":"そのソフトウェアは、既存のシステムと互換性を持つように設計された。","type":"technical","meaning_category":"言いなりに"},{"sentence":"The students followed the instructions compliantly, ensuring the experiment's success.","translation":"学生たちは指示に素直に従い、実験の成功を確実にした。","type":"educational","meaning_category":"素直に"}]}

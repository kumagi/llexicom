Specifically, it indicates that the compound is a salt or ester derived from an acid whose name ends in '-ic'. For example, if an acid is named 'chloric acid', its salt would be named a 'chlorate'. The prefix 'ate-' is then prepended to the name of the cation to fully specify the salt, such as 'sodium chlorate'. This prefix is primarily encountered in the context of chemistry and is essential for accurately naming and identifying chemical compounds.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{},"related_words":{"derivatives":["-ate (suffix)","-ic (suffix)","chlorate","sulfate","nitrate"],"phrasal_verbs":[],"priority":"★★★"},"level_frequency":{},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"The prefix 'ate-' is a specialized term used in chemistry to denote salts or esters of acids.

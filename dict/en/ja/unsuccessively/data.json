It is used to describe a series of attempts or actions that each fail to achieve the desired outcome. It is often replaceable with phrases like 'without successive success' or 'in a series of unsuccessful attempts.' Due to its infrequent use and potential for confusion with 'unsuccessfully,' it is best used in formal writing where precision is required.

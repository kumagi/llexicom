It's formed by combining \"pedestrian\" with the suffix \"-ate.\" Understanding this word requires a good vocabulary base and familiarity with less common word formations. In American English, \"pedestrianize\" is more commonly used as the verb, and \"pedestrian mall\" or \"pedestrian zone\" as the noun."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The local council plans to **pedestrianate** several streets in the city center.","translation":"地方議会は市内中心部のいくつかの通りを歩行者専用にする計画を立てています。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"歩行者専用にする"},{"sentence":"The **pedestrianate** is a popular spot for street performers and vendors.","translation":"歩行者天国はストリートパフォーマーや露店商人に人気の場所です。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"歩行者専用道路"}]}

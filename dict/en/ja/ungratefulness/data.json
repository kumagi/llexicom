It's a more formal way of saying someone lacks gratitude. You'll typically find this word in more sophisticated discussions about human behavior or in literature where the author wants to emphasize the absence of thankfulness as a character flaw or a societal problem. It's important to distinguish it from \"ungrateful,\" which is the adjective used to describe someone who lacks gratitude."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The child's ungratefulness towards his parents was disheartening to witness.","translation":"子供の両親に対する恩知らずな態度は、見ていてがっかりさせられた。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"lack of gratitude"},{"sentence":"Her ungratefulness was evident in her constant complaints despite all the help she received.","translation":"彼女が受けたすべての助けにもかかわらず、絶え間ない不満を言うところに、彼女の恩知らずなところが明らかだった。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"lack of appreciation"},{"sentence":"The politician's ungratefulness to his supporters cost him the election.","translation":"政治家の支持者に対する恩知らずな態度が、選挙での敗北につながった。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"failure to acknowledge kindness"}]}

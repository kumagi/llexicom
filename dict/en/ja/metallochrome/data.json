They are used to visually determine the endpoint of a titration where the concentration of a metal ion is being determined. The color change is due to the difference in the electronic structure of the metallochrome when it is bound to the metal ion versus when it is free in solution.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The metallochrome was used to measure pH.","correct":"✓ The metallochrome was used to detect metal ions.","note":"Metallochromes are specific to metal ions, not pH. pH is measured using acid-base indicators."}],"priority":"★☆☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["metallochromic (adjective)"],"phrasal_verbs":[]},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"The word 'metallochrome' is a technical term used in chemistry, specifically in the context of analytical chemistry and titrations. It refers to a type of chemical indicator that changes color when it binds to a metal ion. Understanding this term requires a background in chemistry, particularly knowledge of complexometric titrations and the behavior of metal ions in solution. The concept involves the formation of colored complexes and the visual determination of titration endpoints, making it a specialized vocabulary word.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The sharp color change of the metallochrome indicated the endpoint of the titration.","translation":"金属指示薬の鮮明な色の変化は、滴定の終点を示した。","type":"general","meaning_category":"definition"},{"sentence":"Different metallochromes are suitable for detecting different metal ions.","translation":"異なる金属指示薬は、異なる金属イオンの検出に適している。","type":"general","meaning_category":"definition"}]}

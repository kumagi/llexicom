It means to congratulate someone in advance, assuming a positive outcome. It's used to express confidence in someone's future success, but can also imply a degree of presumption. Because it is not a common word, it is best used in formal or written contexts where the meaning is clear. It is important to use it carefully, as it can sometimes be interpreted as sarcastic if the expected outcome is not certain."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"I'd like to precongratulate the team on their expected win.","translation":"チームの勝利が期待されるので、事前にお祝い申し上げます。","type":"typical usage","meaning_category":"advance congratulations"},{"sentence":"Let me precongratulate you for your upcoming graduation.","translation":"もうすぐ卒業ですね、事前にお祝いさせてください。","type":"typical usage","meaning_category":"advance congratulations"},{"sentence":"We should precongratulate her on the success of her project.","translation":"彼女のプロジェクトの成功を事前にお祝いすべきでしょう。","type":"typical usage","meaning_category":"advance congratulations"}]}

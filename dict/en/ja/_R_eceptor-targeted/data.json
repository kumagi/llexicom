It refers to something designed to specifically interact with or be delivered to a particular receptor, which is a molecule on the surface or inside of a cell that receives and responds to a signal. This term is commonly used in the context of drug delivery or therapy, where the goal is to selectively target specific cells or tissues, such as cancer cells, while minimizing effects on other parts of the body. Understanding this term requires knowledge of basic biology and pharmacology."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The researchers developed a receptor-targeted contrast agent for enhanced MRI imaging.","translation":"研究者らは、MRIイメージングを強化するための受容体標的化造影剤を開発した。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"受容体標的の"},{"sentence":"Receptor-targeted immunotherapies are being explored as a potential treatment for autoimmune diseases.","translation":"受容体標的化免疫療法は、自己免疫疾患の潜在的な治療法として研究されている。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"受容体標的の"}]}

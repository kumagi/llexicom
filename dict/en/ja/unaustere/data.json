Austerity refers to severity, strictness, simplicity, or a lack of ornamentation. Therefore, \"unaustere\" implies the opposite: a degree of luxury, comfort, leniency, or ornamentation.

To understand 'unaustere,' you need to know what 'austere' means. 'Austere' describes something that is very simple, plain, and without any decoration, or someone who is very strict and serious. Therefore, 'unaustere' describes something that is the opposite: luxurious, comfortable, decorated, or someone who is lenient and affable. This word is more likely to appear in advanced texts or discussions about style, design, or personal qualities."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The hotel room was designed in an unaustere style, featuring plush carpets and ornate chandeliers.","translation":"そのホテルの部屋は豪華なカーペットと華やかなシャンデリアを特徴とする、質素でないスタイルでデザインされていた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"質素でないスタイル"},{"sentence":"Her unaustere personality made her approachable and easy to talk to.","translation":"彼女の厳格でない性格は、彼女に近づきやすく、話しやすくした。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"厳格でない性格"},{"sentence":"The restaurant offered an unaustere dining experience, with a wide variety of rich and flavorful dishes.","translation":"そのレストランは、豊富で風味豊かな料理の数々で、質素でない食事体験を提供した。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"質素でない食事体験"}]}

It is formed by adding the prefix 'un-' to 'barren' and then adding the adverbial suffix '-ly'. It means 'in a way that is not barren' or 'in a productive, fruitful manner'. Because of its rarity, it is generally better to use more common synonyms such as 'fruitfully' or 'productively'.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ She unbarrenly accepted the gift.","correct":"✓ She gratefully accepted the gift.","note":"'Unbarrenly' refers to productivity or fertility, not acceptance.

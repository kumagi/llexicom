It's a subset of hydroponics, which is a broader term for growing plants without soil. Aeroponics is often associated with vertical farming and controlled environment agriculture due to its efficiency and potential for indoor cultivation.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ He is growing aeroponics in his garden.","correct":"✓ He is using an aeroponic system in his garden.","note":"'Aeroponics' is a noun referring to the method itself, while 'aeroponic' is an adjective describing something related to that method.

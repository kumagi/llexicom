Equitable relief is a type of remedy that a court can grant when monetary damages are not adequate to compensate the injured party. It is based on principles of fairness and justice. A quasi-equitable remedy might be granted when the strict requirements for equitable relief are not met, but fairness dictates that some form of relief should be provided.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The decision was equitable, not quasi-equitable.","correct":"✓ The decision was quasi-equitable, not strictly equitable.","note":"Ensure that the situation truly only resembles equitable relief, rather than fully meeting the criteria for it."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["quasi (adverb)","equitable (adjective)","equity (noun)"],"phrasal_verbs":[],"priority":"★★★"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C2","text":"The term \"quasi-equitable\" is a specialized legal term.

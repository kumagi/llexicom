It asserts that a statement is meaningful only if it can be empirically verified, that is, if there are observations that could show it to be true. Statements that are not verifiable, such as those in metaphysics or theology, are considered meaningless, not necessarily false, but lacking cognitive significance. This criterion of meaning faced significant challenges and criticisms, leading to the decline of logical positivism.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Verificationism is a method of proving something is true.","correct":"✓ Verificationism is a philosophical criterion for meaningfulness, requiring empirical verifiability.","note":"Verificationism is not simply about proving something true; it's about whether a statement *can* be verified through experience, regardless of whether it is ultimately proven true or false."},{"incorrect":"✗ All scientific theories are based on verificationism.","correct":"✓ While verificationism influenced early philosophy of science, many modern scientific theories rely on falsification or other criteria.","note":"While verificationism had an impact on the philosophy of science, not all scientific theories adhere to it.

If you can't check it with your senses or experiments, then it's considered meaningless, even if it sounds important. This idea was a big part of a philosophical movement called logical positivism, but it has been criticized a lot and is not as popular as it once was.

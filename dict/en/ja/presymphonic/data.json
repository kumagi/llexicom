It often refers to the orchestral music of the Baroque era (e.g., concerti grossi, orchestral suites) that contributed to the evolution of the symphonic form. The term helps to distinguish between these earlier forms and the more standardized and structured symphonies of composers like Haydn and Mozart.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The presymphonic was a type of musical instrument.","correct":"✓ Presymphonic refers to a period or style of music, not a specific instrument.","note":"'Presymphonic' describes a period or style of music, not a musical instrument or a specific composition."}],"priority":"★☆☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["preclassical","baroque","concerto grosso","symphony","symphonic"],"phrasal_verbs":[],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency.","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"The term 'presymphonic' is a specialized term used in musicology and music history.

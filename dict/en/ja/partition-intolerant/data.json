When a network partition occurs (i.e., the network is split into two or more isolated segments), such a system may choose to shut down or become unavailable to maintain data consistency. This is in contrast to partition-tolerant systems, which are designed to continue operating even in the presence of network partitions, potentially at the cost of temporary data inconsistency.","priority":"medium"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"The system is partition intolerant, so it's very reliable.","correct":"The system is partition-intolerant, so it prioritizes consistency over availability during network failures.","note":"Partition intolerance does not necessarily imply overall reliability, but rather a specific trade-off in the face of network partitions."}],"priority":"low"},"level_frequency":{"frequency_google_ngram":"Low; primarily used in technical discussions about distributed systems.","priority":"low"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Partition-intolerant' is a technical term used in computer science, specifically in the context of distributed systems and the CAP theorem.

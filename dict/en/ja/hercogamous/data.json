The term describes the spatial separation of the male (stamens) and female (pistil) reproductive organs within a flower. This physical barrier makes it difficult or impossible for self-pollination to occur, encouraging the transfer of pollen from one plant to another, often facilitated by pollinators such as insects, birds, or wind.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The plant is hercogamy.","correct":"✓ The plant is hercogamous.","note":"'Hercogamy' is the noun referring to the condition, while 'hercogamous' is the adjective describing a plant exhibiting this condition."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["hercogamy (noun)"],"phrasal_verbs":[],"related_concepts":["dichogamy","self-pollination","cross-pollination","pollination syndromes"]},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C2","text":"'Hercogamous' is a technical term used in botany to describe a specific floral adaptation that prevents self-pollination.

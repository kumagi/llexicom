It can be used as a noun to describe the situation itself, like 'There was a slowup on the road,' meaning traffic was moving slower than usual. It can also be used as a verb, as in 'The project slowed up because of funding issues,' meaning the project's progress became slower. It's similar to 'slowdown' or 'slow down', but 'slowup' is less common. You'll often see it in discussions about traffic, the economy, or project management."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The road construction caused a significant traffic slowup.","translation":"道路工事は重大な交通渋滞を引き起こした。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"減速、遅延"},{"sentence":"Production slowed up during the summer months.","translation":"生産は夏の間、停滞した。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"減速する、遅くなる"}]}

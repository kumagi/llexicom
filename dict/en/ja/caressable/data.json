'Caress' comes from the French word 'caresser', which in turn comes from the Italian word 'carezza', derived from the Latin word 'carus' meaning 'dear' or 'beloved'. The suffix '-able' indicates the capability or suitability of something to be acted upon, in this case, to be caressed.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/kəˈrɛsəbəl/","syllables":"ca-ress-a-ble"},"inflection":{"notes":"This is an adjective, so it can be modified by adverbs (e.g., very caressable, extremely caressable) and can be used in comparative and superlative forms (more caressable, most caressable), although these are less common."},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Caressable' is an adjective that describes something that is pleasing to touch and invites or deserves being caressed. It is often used to describe textures, surfaces, or materials that are soft, smooth, or otherwise pleasant to the touch. The word implies a sense of comfort, desirability, and affection.

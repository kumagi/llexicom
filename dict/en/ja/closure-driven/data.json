It describes a style of programming where closures are used extensively to manage state and behavior. Closures are functions that 'remember' the environment in which they were created, even after that environment is no longer active. This allows for more flexible and powerful code, but can also be more complex to understand. This term is typically encountered in discussions about functional programming, asynchronous programming, and event-driven architectures."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The React library uses a closure-driven mechanism for managing component state.","translation":"Reactライブラリは、コンポーネントの状態を管理するためにクロージャ駆動のメカニズムを使用します。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"クロージャに基づいた"},{"sentence":"The new framework is designed with a closure-driven architecture to improve code modularity.","translation":"新しいフレームワークは、コードのモジュール性を向上させるために、クロージャ駆動のアーキテクチャで設計されています。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"クロージャに基づいた"}]}

Trigonometry is a branch of mathematics that deals with the relationships between the sides and angles of triangles. The sine function relates an angle of a right triangle to the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse. 'Sines' would be used when discussing multiple angles or a range of values, such as in a graph of the sine function.

It is used to emphasize an exceptionally high level of safety or security. It is more emphatic than 'safely' and suggests that all possible precautions have been taken to ensure safety.

It's not a commonly used word, so it's more likely to appear in technical or specialized contexts where there's a need to emphasize a very high level of safety. Because it's formed by adding 'super-' to 'safely,' its meaning is relatively transparent, but it's still considered advanced vocabulary because of its infrequent use."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The hazardous waste was disposed of supersafely according to all regulations.","translation":"有害廃棄物はすべての規制に従い、極めて安全に処分されました。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"極めて安全に"},{"sentence":"The company prides itself on handling sensitive information supersafely.","translation":"その会社は機密情報を非常に安全に取り扱うことを誇りに思っています。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"非常に安全に"}]}

It implies a moderate level of health, condition, or quality. It is often used in response to inquiries about one's health or to describe something that is just acceptable or passable.

'Wellish' already implies a moderate degree, so 'very' is unnecessary. Use 'quite well' or simply 'well' for a stronger affirmation, or use 'feeling wellish' to indicate a moderate state."},{"incorrect":"✗ The food was wellish delicious.","correct":"✓ The food was fairly delicious. / ✓ The food was wellish, but not delicious.","note":"'Wellish' should modify the general state or quality, not a specific adjective like 'delicious'.

It's used to describe something that's not great, but not bad either. For example, if someone asks how you're feeling and you're not 100%, you might say 'I'm feeling wellish'. It's a subtle way to indicate a state that's just okay or passable. Because it's not very common, it's more likely to be encountered in advanced English texts or conversations."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"After a week of rest, she was feeling wellish and ready to return to work.","translation":"一週間の休養の後、彼女はまあまあ元気になり、仕事に戻る準備ができていた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"health"},{"sentence":"The weather was wellish, but not ideal for swimming.","translation":"天気はまあまあ良かったが、水泳には理想的ではなかった。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"condition"},{"sentence":"The presentation went wellish, considering the limited preparation time.","translation":"準備時間が限られていたことを考えると、プレゼンテーションはまあまあうまくいった。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"degree"}]}

It describes the process of a spacecraft or module detaching from a docking port and then reattaching to the same or a different port. The term emphasizes the intentional nature of the undocking and redocking, often as part of a planned maneuver or operation.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{},"related_words":{"derivatives":["redocketing"],"phrasal_verbs":[]},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"N/A (専門用語)","frequency_google_ngram":"非常に低頻度 (Very low frequency)","priority":"☆☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C2","text":"\"Redocket\" is a highly specialized term used in the field of spaceflight. It refers to the process of a spacecraft or module undocking (detaching) from a space station or another spacecraft and then docking (reattaching) again, either to the same port or a different one. This maneuver might be performed for various reasons, such as repositioning a module, conducting inspections, or preparing for a different phase of a mission. Due to its specific context, it is unlikely to be encountered outside of technical discussions related to space exploration and engineering."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The astronauts prepared for the redocket of the cargo module to the nadir port.","translation":"宇宙飛行士たちは、貨物モジュールを船底ポートに再ドッキングする準備をした。","type":"both","meaning_category":"spaceflight"}]}

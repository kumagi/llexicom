The noun form is typically used in the singular."},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"Paramagnetism is a form of magnetism where some materials are weakly attracted by an externally applied magnetic field, and form internal, induced magnetic fields in the direction of the applied magnetic field. These materials are attracted to magnetic fields, hence the prefix 'para', but do not retain any permanent magnetism when the external field is removed. Paramagnetic materials include most chemical elements and some compounds; they have a small, positive susceptibility to magnetic fields.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"The paramagnetic is strongly attracted to magnets.","correct":"The paramagnetic is weakly attracted to magnets.","note":"Paramagnetic materials are weakly attracted to magnets, unlike ferromagnetic materials which are strongly attracted."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["paramagnetism (noun)"],"phrasal_verbs":[],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C1","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"The term 'paramagnetic' is a scientific term used in physics and chemistry to describe materials that are weakly attracted to magnetic fields.

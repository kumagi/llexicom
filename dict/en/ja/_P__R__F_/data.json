It refers to how often a pulse is transmitted. A higher PRF means more pulses are sent per second, which can improve the radar's ability to detect fast-moving targets but may reduce its maximum range. Conversely, a lower PRF can increase the maximum range but may make it harder to detect fast-moving targets.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{},"related_words":{"derivatives":["pulse width","duty cycle"],"acronyms":["PRI (Pulse Repetition Interval)"],"related_terms":["radar","signal processing","telecommunications"],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"PRF stands for Pulse Repetition Frequency. It's a technical term used in radar and signal processing. It refers to the number of pulses that are transmitted per second.

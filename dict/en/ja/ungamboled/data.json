It describes a state of not engaging in playful skipping or frolicking. It is most often used to describe children or young animals, but can be applied to anyone or anything that might be expected to move about playfully.

It is formed by adding the prefix 'un-' to 'gamboled,' the past participle of 'gambol' (to skip or frolic playfully). Due to its rarity, it is unlikely to be encountered in everyday conversation or writing. Understanding the word requires familiarity with its root, 'gambol,' which itself is not commonly used. The word is most likely to appear in older literature or in contexts where the author is aiming for a particularly archaic or whimsical effect."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The puppies, usually a whirlwind of energy, lay ungamboled in their basket, exhausted from their first adventure outside.","translation":"普段はエネルギーの塊である子犬たちは、初めての外での冒険で疲れ果てて、かごの中で跳ね回ることもなく横たわっていた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"Not having gamboled"},{"sentence":"After the somber ceremony, even the most spirited guests felt ungamboled and reflective.","translation":"厳粛な儀式の後、最も元気な客でさえ、跳ね回る気分にはなれず、物思いにふけっていた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"Not having gamboled"}]}

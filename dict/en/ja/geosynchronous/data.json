A key characteristic is that the orbiting object, such as a satellite, takes the same amount of time to orbit the Earth as the Earth takes to rotate once on its axis (approximately 24 hours). This results in the satellite returning to the same position in the sky after each orbit. A special case of geosynchronous orbit is the geostationary orbit, where the satellite remains fixed in the sky relative to a point on the Earth's surface.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The satellite is geostationary, so it is not geosynchronous.","correct":"✓ The satellite is geostationary, so it is geosynchronous.","note":"Geostationary orbits are a subset of geosynchronous orbits.

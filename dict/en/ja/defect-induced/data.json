These defects can be point defects (vacancies, interstitials), line defects (dislocations), or planar defects (grain boundaries, surfaces). The presence of these defects can significantly alter the material's behavior, leading to changes in its mechanical, electrical, optical, or chemical properties.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The induced-defect material.","correct":"✓ The defect-induced material.","note":"The order of the words matters. \"Defect-induced\" correctly describes something caused by defects, while \"induced-defect\" is not a standard term."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["defect","induced","induce"],"related_terms":["point defect","line defect","planar defect","material defect","crystal defect"],"priority":"★★★"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency.

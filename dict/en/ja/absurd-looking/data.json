It combines the concept of something being 'absurd' (unreasonable or illogical) with the visual aspect of 'looking' a certain way. It's typically used in descriptive contexts to convey that something's appearance is strikingly odd or comical. Because it's a compound word, understanding the individual components helps in grasping its meaning. It is not a very common term, but understanding the individual words makes it easy to understand."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The scarecrow in the field had an absurd-looking grin painted on its face.","translation":"畑のかかしは、顔にばかげた外見の笑みが描かれていた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"appearance"},{"sentence":"The dog trotted down the street wearing an absurd-looking pair of sunglasses.","translation":"その犬はばかげた外見のサングラスをかけて通りを小走りしていた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"appearance"},{"sentence":"The artist created an absurd-looking sculpture out of recycled materials.","translation":"その芸術家はリサイクル素材から不条理な外観の彫刻を制作した。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"appearance"}]}

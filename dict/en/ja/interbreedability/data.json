It refers to the capacity of two different species or populations to intermate and produce offspring that are both viable (able to survive) and fertile (able to reproduce themselves). The concept is important for understanding how species boundaries are maintained and how gene flow can occur between populations. The term is not commonly used outside of scientific contexts.

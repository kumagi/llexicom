It refers to the process of using a liquid solvent to selectively dissolve and separate soluble components from a solid mixture. The term is often used interchangeably with 'leaching,' although 'lixiviation' tends to be used in more formal or technical contexts. In mining, lixiviation is a crucial step in extracting valuable metals from ores. In soil science, it describes the natural process where water carries away soluble minerals and nutrients from the upper layers of soil.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Lixiviation is the same as filtration.","correct":"✓ Lixiviation involves dissolving soluble components, while filtration involves separating solid particles from a liquid.","note":"Lixiviation is a chemical process involving dissolution, whereas filtration is a physical process involving separation of solids from liquids.

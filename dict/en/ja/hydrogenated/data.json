Hydrogenation is a chemical process where hydrogen is added to an unsaturated compound, making it more saturated. This process is often used to convert liquid oils into solid or semi-solid fats, increasing their stability and shelf life. However, it can also create trans fats, which are considered unhealthy. Therefore, the presence and type of hydrogenated oils are important considerations in food labeling and nutrition.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The hydrogenated is good for health.","correct":"✓ Hydrogenated oils are not generally considered good for health.","note":"'Hydrogenated' is an adjective, so it needs to modify a noun.

It describes a process where hydrogen is added to a substance, most commonly unsaturated fats and oils. This process changes the physical properties of the substance, often making it more solid and increasing its shelf life. However, it can also create trans fats, which are associated with negative health effects. Understanding the term 'hydrogenated' is important for interpreting food labels and understanding discussions about nutrition and food processing. The word is not commonly used in everyday conversation.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"Many margarines are made from hydrogenated vegetable oils.","translation":"多くのマーガリンは水素添加された植物油から作られています。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"describing composition"},{"sentence":"The company uses a proprietary process to hydrogenate the oil.","translation":"その会社は、油を水素添加するために独自のプロセスを使用しています。","type":"verb (past participle)","meaning_category":"describing a process"},{"sentence":"Consumers are increasingly aware of the health implications of hydrogenated fats.","translation":"消費者は、水素添加された脂肪の健康への影響をますます認識しています。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"health context"}]}

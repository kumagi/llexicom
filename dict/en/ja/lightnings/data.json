'Lightning' itself comes from the Middle English 'lightnyng', derived from 'lighten' (to emit light). The suffix '-ing' indicates an action or process, so 'lightning' originally referred to the act of emitting light.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/ˈlaɪtnɪŋz/","syllables":"light-nings"},"inflection":{"noun_plural":"lightnings (less common, usually 'lightning' is used as an uncountable noun)"},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"While 'lightning' is typically used as an uncountable noun to refer to the general phenomenon of electrical discharge in the atmosphere, 'lightnings' can be used as a countable noun to refer to individual instances or flashes of lightning.

Usually, we use 'lightning' as an uncountable noun, like 'water' or 'air'. So, instead of saying 'I saw many lightnings', it's more common to say 'I saw a lot of lightning' or 'I saw many flashes of lightning'. 'Lightnings' is grammatically correct, but it sounds a bit unusual to native English speakers. It's better to stick with 'lightning' unless you have a specific reason to use the plural form."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"During the storm, we saw several intense lightnings.","translation":"嵐の間、私たちはいくつかの強烈な雷を見た。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"雷"},{"sentence":"The book described the power of nature, including volcanoes and lightnings.","translation":"その本は、火山や雷を含む自然の力を説明していた。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"雷"},{"sentence":"The old text mentioned 'lightnings' as a sign of the gods' anger.","translation":"その古いテキストは、神々の怒りの兆候として「雷」に言及していた。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"雷"}]}

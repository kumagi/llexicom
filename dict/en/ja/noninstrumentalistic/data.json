'Instrumentalistic' itself comes from 'instrumentalism,' which is derived from 'instrument' (a tool or means) with the suffix '-ism' (denoting a doctrine or practice). Thus, 'noninstrumentalistic' means 'not related to the doctrine of using things merely as instruments or tools'.","priority":"☆☆☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/ˌnɒnɪnstrʊmənˈtælɪstɪk/","syllables":"non-in-stru-men-tal-is-tic"},"inflection":{"notes":"Adjectives do not typically inflect in English, except for comparative and superlative forms, which are not commonly used with 'noninstrumentalistic'."},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Noninstrumentalistic' is used to describe perspectives, values, or approaches that do not treat things solely as instruments or means to an end.

It describes a viewpoint that values things for their own sake, not just for their usefulness. Understanding this word requires familiarity with the concept of instrumentalism, which is the belief that things are only valuable as tools to achieve a goal. 'Noninstrumentalistic' thinking, on the other hand, recognizes intrinsic value, meaning something is important in and of itself, regardless of its practical applications."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"Her noninstrumentalistic view of education emphasized personal growth over career preparation.","translation":"彼女の教育に対する非道具主義的な見解は、キャリアの準備よりも個人の成長を重視していた。","type":"general","meaning_category":"General Use"},{"sentence":"The ethical framework promoted a noninstrumentalistic treatment of animals.","translation":"その倫理的枠組みは、動物に対する非道具主義的な扱いを推進した。","type":"ethical","meaning_category":"Ethics"},{"sentence":"A noninstrumentalistic approach to art appreciates its beauty and emotional impact, not just its market value.","translation":"芸術に対する非道具主義的なアプローチは、その市場価値だけでなく、その美しさや感情的な影響を評価する。","type":"art","meaning_category":"Art"}]}

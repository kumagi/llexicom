It suggests that something is predictable, repetitive, and lacks variation.

Because it's less frequent, it's more likely to be encountered in advanced texts or when someone wants to emphasize the dull or repetitive nature of something.","priority":"★☆☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The daily commute had become a routinish chore.","translation":"毎日の通勤は日常的な雑用になっていた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"日常的な、型通りの"},{"sentence":"The tasks were so routinish that she could do them without thinking.","translation":"作業があまりにも日常的だったので、彼女は考えずにそれらをこなすことができた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"決まりきった"},{"sentence":"He longed for something more exciting than his routinish existence.","translation":"彼は日常的な生活よりももっとエキサイティングな何かを切望していた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"型通りの"}]}

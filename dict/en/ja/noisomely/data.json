Over time, it came to mean 'offensive' or 'disgusting', especially in terms of smell or sound.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/ˈnɔɪsəm.li/","syllables":"noi-some-ly"},"inflection":{"notes":"Adverb, does not inflect."},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Noisomely' describes something done in a way that is offensive or disgusting, often due to a bad smell or loud, unpleasant noise. It is not a common word in modern English. It is more frequently used in descriptive writing to create a vivid and negative impression.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"The flowers smelled noisomely.","correct":"The flowers smelled foully. / The flowers had a noisome scent.","note":"'Noisomely' is used to describe the manner in which something is done or occurs. It doesn't directly describe the subject itself. In this case, 'foully' is a better choice for describing a bad smell. To use 'noisome' correctly, you could say 'The noisome scent of the flowers filled the room'."},{"incorrect":"The baby cried noisomely.","correct":"The baby cried loudly and unpleasantly.","note":"While 'noisomely' can imply unpleasant sounds, it's more often associated with foul smells. For a baby's cry, it's better to use more direct descriptions like 'loudly and unpleasantly' because 'noisomely' might suggest there's something disgusting or offensive about the crying itself, rather than just that it's loud and annoying."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["noisome (adjective: offensive, disgusting, foul-smelling)","noise (noun: a sound, especially when loud or unpleasant)"],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2 (Rare and literary)","frequency_google_ngram":"Very low frequency","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Noisomely' is an advanced word that describes something done in an offensive or disgusting manner, often involving unpleasant sounds or smells.

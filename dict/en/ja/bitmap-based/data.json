Bitmaps are digital images composed of a grid of pixels, where each pixel's color is individually defined. Bitmap-based systems or software often involve manipulating these pixel values directly. This contrasts with vector-based systems, which use mathematical equations to define shapes and lines, allowing for scalability without loss of quality.","priority":"☆☆☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The image is bitmap based.","correct":"✓ The image is bitmap-based.","note":"Hyphenation is important for compound adjectives like 'bitmap-based'."}],"priority":"☆☆☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["bitmap","raster"],"related_terms":["vector-based","pixel","rasterization"]},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C1","frequency_google_ngram":"Low","priority":"☆☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"The term 'bitmap-based' is technical and specific to computer graphics and image processing.

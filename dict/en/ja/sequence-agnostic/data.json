It describes systems, algorithms, or models that are designed to function independently of the order of their inputs. This property can be desirable for efficiency, robustness, or when the order of the data is inherently irrelevant.

It describes something that doesn't care about the order of the things it's working with. Imagine you have a recipe, and it says to add sugar, flour, and eggs. If the recipe is sequence-agnostic, it means you can add them in any order, and the result will still be the same. It's the opposite of something that's 'sequence-dependent', where the order matters a lot. This term is typically used when discussing algorithms, data structures, or models where the order of input doesn't affect the output."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The image recognition system is sequence-agnostic; it identifies objects regardless of their position in the image.","translation":"その画像認識システムは順序に依存しません。画像内のオブジェクトの位置に関係なくオブジェクトを識別します。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"順序に依存しない"},{"sentence":"We need a sequence-agnostic method for processing these transactions.","translation":"これらのトランザクションを処理するための順序に依存しない方法が必要です。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"順序を考慮しない"},{"sentence":"The algorithm's sequence-agnostic nature makes it suitable for parallel processing.","translation":"アルゴリズムの順序に依存しない性質により、並列処理に適しています。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"順序に依存しない"}]}

It is formed by adding the prefix \"quasi-\" (meaning \"almost\" or \"resembling\") to the adverb \"dejectedly.\" To understand the word, one must first understand \"dejected,\" which means feeling or showing sadness and discouragement. The prefix \"quasi-\" softens the meaning, indicating that the feeling is not fully present but is suggested or implied.

As a verb (rare), it follows regular verb inflection patterns."},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"The term 'hydrogen-treated' is most commonly used in the context of chemistry and industry, particularly in the processing of oils, fuels, and other chemical substances. The process typically involves reacting the substance with hydrogen gas under specific conditions to achieve a desired chemical modification. This can include saturating unsaturated bonds (e.g., in oils to make them more stable) or removing impurities (e.g., sulfur from fuels). The term is often used in product descriptions and technical specifications.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The hydrogen treated oil was rancid.","correct":"✓ The hydrogen-treated oil was rancid.","note":"The hyphen is important to show that 'hydrogen' modifies 'treated' and that the two words together act as a single adjective modifying 'oil'."},{"incorrect":"✗ They hydrogened treated the oil.","correct":"✓ They hydrogen-treated the oil. / ✓ They hydrogenated the oil.","note":"'Hydrogen-treated' is often used as a single adjective.

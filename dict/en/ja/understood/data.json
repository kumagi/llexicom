'Understand' itself comes from Old English 'understandan', meaning 'to comprehend, grasp the idea of, know the intention of'. It's a combination of 'under' (among, between, before) and 'standan' (to stand). The original sense was likely 'to stand in the midst of' or 'to stand before' something mentally, thus comprehending it.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/ˌʌndərˈstʊd/","syllables":"un-der-stood"},"inflection":{"notes":"'Understood' is the past participle and past simple form of the verb 'understand'.

It involves the absorption of moisture (hydration) and carbon dioxide (carbonation), leading to the formation of calcium hydroxide and calcium carbonate, respectively. This process causes the quicklime to expand and crumble, reducing its binding properties. It's a significant concern in the preservation of historical buildings using lime mortars.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Water-slaking is the same as air-slaking.","correct":"✓ Water-slaking is a different process from air-slaking.","note":"Water-slaking involves the direct addition of water to quicklime, while air-slaking occurs through the gradual absorption of moisture from the air."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["slake (verb)","quicklime (noun)","lime (noun)","hydration (noun)","carbonation (noun)"],"phrasal_verbs":[],"priority":"★★★"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency - Specialized term used in construction, chemistry, and historical preservation.","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"\"Air-slaking\" refers to the deterioration of quicklime due to exposure to air.

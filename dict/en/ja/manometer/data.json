It typically works by comparing the pressure being measured to a reference pressure, such as atmospheric pressure. There are different types of manometers, including U-tube manometers, which use a liquid column to indicate pressure, and digital manometers, which provide a numerical readout.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Use a barometer to measure the pressure in the pipe.","correct":"✓ Use a manometer to measure the pressure in the pipe.","note":"A barometer measures atmospheric pressure, while a manometer is used for measuring pressure in closed systems like pipes.

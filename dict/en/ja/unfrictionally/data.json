It describes something happening without friction, implying a very smooth and efficient process. It is most likely to be encountered in technical or scientific contexts where the reduction of friction is important. Due to its relative rarity, it is less likely to appear in general conversation or writing. It is formed by adding the prefix 'un-' to 'frictionally', which in turn is derived from 'friction'. Understanding the root word 'friction' is key to understanding 'unfrictionally'."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The piston moved unfrictionally within the cylinder, maximizing the engine's efficiency.","translation":"ピストンはシリンダー内を摩擦なく動き、エンジンの効率を最大化した。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"without friction"},{"sentence":"The negotiation process proceeded unfrictionally due to the clear communication between both parties.","translation":"交渉プロセスは、両当事者間の明確なコミュニケーションにより、円滑に進んだ。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"smoothly"}]}

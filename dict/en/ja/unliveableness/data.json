It is formed from \"liveable\" (suitable for living) with the addition of the prefixes \"un-\" (not) and \"-ness\" (state or quality). Therefore, it describes the state or quality of being unliveable, meaning a place or situation is extremely difficult or impossible to live in due to severe conditions or problems. It is often used in discussions about social issues, environmental problems, or extreme living conditions. Because of its complexity and infrequent use, it is more likely to be encountered in advanced academic or professional contexts."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The extreme poverty and lack of sanitation contributed to the unliveableness of the slum.","translation":"極度の貧困と衛生設備の欠如が、そのスラムの住みにくさに拍車をかけた。","type":"general","meaning_category":"place/situation"},{"sentence":"Many factors, including pollution and overcrowding, increased the unliveableness of the megacity.","translation":"汚染や過密状態を含む多くの要因が、その巨大都市の住みにくさを増大させた。","type":"general","meaning_category":"place/situation"},{"sentence":"The constant fear for her safety added to the unliveableness of her daily life.","translation":"絶え間ない身の危険に対する恐怖が、彼女の日常生活の耐え難さを増した。","type":"abstract","meaning_category":"life/existence"}]}

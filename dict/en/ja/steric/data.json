Understanding requires familiarity with basic concepts of molecular structure and chemical reactions. The most common usage is in the context of 'steric hindrance', which describes how the spatial arrangement of atoms can block or slow down chemical reactions. Therefore, understanding is linked to knowledge of chemistry.

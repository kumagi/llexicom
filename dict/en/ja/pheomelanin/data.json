Pheomelanin is responsible for the reddish and yellowish pigments in hair, skin, and feathers, while eumelanin is responsible for brown and black pigments. The relative amounts of pheomelanin and eumelanin determine an individual's hair and skin color. People with red hair have a high proportion of pheomelanin and a low proportion of eumelanin. Pheomelanin is also associated with increased sensitivity to ultraviolet (UV) radiation and a higher risk of skin cancer.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Pheomelanin is a type of eumelanin.","correct":"✓ Pheomelanin and eumelanin are two different types of melanin.","note":"Pheomelanin and eumelanin are distinct types of melanin, not subtypes of each other."},{"incorrect":"✗ Pheomelanin protects the skin from UV radiation.","correct":"✓ Pheomelanin is associated with increased sensitivity to UV radiation.","note":"Unlike eumelanin, pheomelanin does not provide significant protection against UV radiation and may even contribute to oxidative stress in the skin."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["pheomelanogenesis"],"phrasal_verbs":[],"related_terms":["melanin","eumelanin","melanocyte","pigmentation","tyrosinase"],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"\"Pheomelanin\" is a technical term primarily used in the fields of biology, genetics, and dermatology.

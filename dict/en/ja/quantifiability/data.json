It is often used in scientific research, business analysis, and other fields where objective measurement is important. It is related to the concept of \"measurement\" but emphasizes the possibility or ease of assigning numerical values to something. High quantifiability implies that something can be easily and accurately measured, while low quantifiability suggests that it is difficult to obtain precise numerical data.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"The quantifiability is important.","correct":"The quantifiability of the data is important.","note":"It's better to specify what is being quantified.

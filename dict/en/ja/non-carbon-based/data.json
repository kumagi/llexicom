It describes something that does not have carbon as its main component. This term is most often used when discussing the possibility of life forms that are very different from those on Earth, or when discussing materials that are not made from carbon. Because it is a technical term, it is not commonly used in everyday conversation."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The research explores the potential of non-carbon-based semiconductors.","translation":"その研究は、炭素を基盤としない半導体の可能性を探求している。","type":"general","meaning_category":"Technology"},{"sentence":"Some theories propose that life on other planets could be non-carbon-based.","translation":"いくつかの理論は、他の惑星の生命は炭素を基盤としない可能性があると提唱している。","type":"general","meaning_category":"Astrobiology"}]}

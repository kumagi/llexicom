It describes a process where something, like a virus or bacteria, is made harmless by exposing it to light. Often, a special chemical called a 'photosensitizer' is used to make the light more effective. This term is common in discussions about sterilization, disinfection, and blood safety. Understanding it requires familiarity with scientific concepts.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The hospital uses photo-inactivated saline to clean wounds.","translation":"病院では、傷を洗浄するために光不活化された生理食塩水を使用している。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"disinfection"},{"sentence":"Researchers are exploring photo-inactivated vaccines as a safer alternative.","translation":"研究者たちは、より安全な代替手段として光不活化ワクチンを研究している。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"vaccines"},{"sentence":"The study investigated the efficacy of photo-inactivated platelet concentrates.","translation":"その研究では、光不活化された血小板濃厚液の有効性が調査された。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"blood products"}]}

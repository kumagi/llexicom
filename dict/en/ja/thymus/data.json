It is responsible for the maturation of T lymphocytes (T cells), which play a critical role in cell-mediated immunity. The thymus is relatively large and active during the prenatal period and childhood, but it undergoes involution (shrinking) after puberty. While the thymus is primarily associated with immune function, it is also sometimes encountered in culinary contexts, where it is referred to as 'sweetbread'. Understanding the thymus is important in fields such as immunology, medicine, and developmental biology."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The **thymus** plays a vital role in the development of the immune system.","translation":"胸腺は免疫系の発達において重要な役割を果たします。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"anatomy"},{"sentence":"Doctors removed the patient's **thymus** due to a tumor.","translation":"医師たちは腫瘍のため患者の胸腺を摘出した。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"medicine"},{"sentence":"The **thymus** is located behind the sternum.","translation":"胸腺は胸骨の後ろに位置しています。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"anatomy"}]}

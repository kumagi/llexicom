Understanding this word requires familiarity with the concept of trace fossils (ichnofossils), which are not the remains of an organism's body, but rather evidence of its activity, such as footprints, burrows, or feeding traces. The term is used to describe studies, analyses, or records related to these trace fossils. Due to its specific and technical nature, it's unlikely to be encountered outside of academic or professional contexts.","example_sentences":[]},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The ichnological data suggested that several different species of dinosaurs inhabited the area.","translation":"その生痕学的データは、数種類の異なる恐竜がその地域に生息していたことを示唆していた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"Relating to ichnology"},{"sentence":"An ichnological survey was conducted to identify and map the trace fossils in the sedimentary rock.","translation":"堆積岩中の生痕化石を特定し、地図化するために、生痕学的調査が実施された。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"Relating to ichnology"}]}

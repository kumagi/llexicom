It's not commonly used in everyday conversation. Instead, words like \"drunkenness\" or \"intoxication\" are more frequently used. You might encounter \"unsobriety\" in legal or official contexts when referring to someone's state of inebriation. It is formed by adding the prefix \"un-\" to \"sobriety,\" which means the state of being sober or temperate. Therefore, \"unsobriety\" represents the opposite of being sober."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The report detailed the levels of unsobriety among the arrested individuals.","translation":"その報告書は、逮捕された人々の酩酊の程度を詳細に記述した。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"酩酊"},{"sentence":"His unsobriety was a contributing factor to the accident.","translation":"彼の酩酊は事故の要因の一つだった。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"酩酊"},{"sentence":"The judge warned against the dangers of public unsobriety.","translation":"裁判官は公然酩酊の危険性について警告した。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"酩酊"}]}

This allows for bidirectional flow of electricity, meaning the user can draw power from the grid when needed and also supply excess power back to the grid, often receiving credit or payment for it. This is a common setup for residential and commercial solar panel installations.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The house is connected to the grid, but it's grid-isolated.","correct":"✓ The house is connected to the grid.","note":"'Grid-isolated' is contradictory to 'grid-connected'.

The word 'crawly' itself has a few meanings: 1) literally moving by crawling, 2) infested with crawling things (like insects), or 3) causing a creepy or unsettling feeling. Therefore, 'crawliest' means 'most prone to crawling', 'most infested with crawling things', or 'most creepy'. It's not a very common word, so it's more likely to be encountered in descriptive writing or figurative language. Understanding the base word 'crawl' and the suffix '-est' is key to understanding 'crawliest'."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"That abandoned house had the **crawliest** atmosphere; it felt like spiders were everywhere.","translation":"あの廃屋は一番ぞっとするような雰囲気だった。まるでクモがどこにでもいるようだった。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"most creepy"},{"sentence":"This is the **crawliest** traffic jam I've ever been in; we've barely moved in an hour.","translation":"これは今までで一番のろのろした交通渋滞だ。一時間ほとんど動いていない。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"slowest-moving"},{"sentence":"Of all the bugs in the garden, the caterpillar was the **crawliest**.","translation":"庭の全ての虫の中で、イモムシが一番這うようだった。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"most prone to crawling"}]}

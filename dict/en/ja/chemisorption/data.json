It refers to a type of adsorption where a chemical reaction occurs between the adsorbate and the adsorbent, resulting in a chemical bond. Understanding this term requires a background in chemistry, particularly surface chemistry and thermodynamics. It is often contrasted with physisorption, which involves weaker, physical forces rather than chemical bonds."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The **chemisorption** of hydrogen on nickel is an important step in many catalytic reactions.","translation":"ニッケルへの水素の化学吸着は、多くの触媒反応における重要なステップです。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"chemical adsorption"},{"sentence":"**Chemisorption** is characterized by high activation energies and the formation of chemical bonds.","translation":"化学吸着は、高い活性化エネルギーと化学結合の形成によって特徴付けられます。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"chemical adsorption"},{"sentence":"The rate of **chemisorption** is dependent on the temperature and pressure of the system.","translation":"化学吸着の速度は、系の温度と圧力に依存します。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"chemical adsorption"}]}

This process removes impurities and aligns the carbon atoms into a more ordered, crystalline structure, resulting in improved electrical and thermal conductivity compared to other forms of carbon. It is widely used in applications requiring high electrical conductivity, thermal stability, and lubricity.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ electro graphite","correct":"✓ electrographite","note":"The term is a single word, not two separate words."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["graphite","carbon","graphitization"],"phrasal_verbs":[]},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Electrographite' is a technical term specific to materials science and electrical engineering. It refers to a particular type of graphite produced through a high-temperature electrical process.

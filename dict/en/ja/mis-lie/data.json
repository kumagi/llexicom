It is much more common to simply use the verb 'lie'. The prefix 'mis-' usually indicates doing something badly or wrongly, but with 'lie', it doesn't add significant meaning beyond simply 'to lie'. Therefore, it's generally better to avoid using 'mis-lie' and use 'lie' instead.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ He mis-lied me about his age.","correct":"✓ He lied to me about his age.","note":"It's more natural and common to say 'lie to someone' rather than 'mis-lie someone'."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["mislead (verb: to give the wrong idea or impression)","lie (verb: to tell an untruth; noun: an untruth)"],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"N/A (very rare)","frequency_google_ngram":"Extremely rare - usage is negligible.","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C2","text":"The word 'mis-lie' is a very rare and uncommon word. It is formed by adding the prefix 'mis-' to the word 'lie'. Although grammatically correct, it is not typically used in modern English. Instead, the simpler word 'lie' is preferred. Because of its rarity, it is best to avoid using this word. It is more important to understand the meaning of the prefix 'mis-' and the word 'lie' separately."},"example_sentences":[]}

It refers to the process of converting a string to a form where case differences are ignored, typically by converting all characters to lowercase. This is done to ensure that comparisons between strings are case-insensitive. For example, if you case-fold the strings 'Hello' and 'hello', both would become 'hello', allowing them to be recognized as equal. This term is commonly used in programming documentation and specifications related to string manipulation. It's important to note that case-folding is different from simple lowercasing in some languages, as it may involve more complex character mappings to handle Unicode characters correctly."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The search engine uses case-folding to find results regardless of capitalization.","translation":"検索エンジンは、大文字と小文字に関係なく結果を見つけるために、小文字変換を使用します。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"convert to lowercase"},{"sentence":"The case-fold of the string is used for comparison.","translation":"文字列の小文字変換は比較に使用されます。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"lowercased string"}]}

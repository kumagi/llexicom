It is characterized by its large blastocoel (fluid-filled cavity) and the relatively small amount of yolk present in the egg. This type of blastula is typically found in organisms that undergo holoblastic cleavage, where the entire egg divides during cell division.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[],"priority":"☆☆☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["holoblastic","blastula","gastrulation"],"phrasal_verbs":[],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"N/A","frequency_google_ngram":"Very low frequency","priority":"☆☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C2","text":"'Hologastrula' is a technical term used in developmental biology.

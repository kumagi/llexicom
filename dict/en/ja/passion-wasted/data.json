Understanding it requires grasping the concept of 'passion' as intense enthusiasm or desire, and 'wasted' as something used ineffectively or squandered. The term is used to describe a situation or person where that intense enthusiasm has been misdirected, unfulfilled, or used to no meaningful purpose. It's often used in contexts discussing career dissatisfaction, unfulfilled potential, or the regret of pursuing goals that weren't truly aligned with one's values. Because of its abstract nature and relatively low frequency, it's more likely to be encountered in advanced texts or discussions.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The artist felt passion-wasted after creating commercial art that lacked personal meaning.","translation":"そのアーティストは、個人的な意味を欠いた商業アートを制作した後、情熱を無駄にしたと感じた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"Unfulfilled potential"},{"sentence":"Many graduates find themselves passion-wasted in jobs that don't align with their values.","translation":"多くの卒業生は、自分の価値観と一致しない仕事で情熱を無駄にしていることに気づく。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"Misdirected enthusiasm"},{"sentence":"The abandoned research project became a symbol of passion-wasted resources and talent.","translation":"放棄された研究プロジェクトは、情熱を無駄にした資源と才能の象徴となった。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"Squandered resources"}]}

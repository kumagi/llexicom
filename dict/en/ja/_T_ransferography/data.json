It involves physically transferring a photographic image, typically from a print or emulsion, to another surface like paper, canvas, or even other materials. This process often introduces imperfections, textures, and distortions, making each transfer unique. It is not a mainstream technique but is valued for its artistic potential.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ I used transferography to scan the document.","correct":"✓ I used a scanner to scan the document.","note":"Transferography is a photographic image transfer technique, not a method for scanning documents.

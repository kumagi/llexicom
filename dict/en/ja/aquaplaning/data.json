It happens when a layer of water builds up between the tires of a vehicle and the road surface, causing the tires to lose traction and the driver to lose control. To avoid aquaplaning, it's important to reduce speed and maintain good tire tread. The term is most often used in discussions about driving safety and vehicle maintenance."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The heavy rain increased the risk of **aquaplaning**.","translation":"大雨はハイドロプレーニング現象のリスクを高めました。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"ハイドロプレーニング現象"},{"sentence":"As the car hit the deep puddle, it began to **aquaplane**.","translation":"車が深い水たまりに突入したとき、ハイドロプレーニング現象を起こし始めました。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"ハイドロプレーニング現象を起こす"}]}

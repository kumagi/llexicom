This is different from simply deleting files, which leaves traces of the data that can be recovered using specialized software. Data-wiping typically involves overwriting the data multiple times with random patterns to ensure complete erasure. It's crucial for security and privacy when disposing of old devices or reassigning them to new users.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ data wiping is the same as deleting files.","correct":"✓ data wiping is more secure than simply deleting files.","note":"Deleting files does not completely remove the data, whereas data wiping overwrites the data to make it unrecoverable."},{"incorrect":"✗ data wiping can always recover lost data.","correct":"✓ data wiping permanently removes data.","note":"Data wiping is for erasing data, not recovering it."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["wipe (verb, noun)","data (noun)","sanitization (noun)","erasure (noun)"],"phrasal_verbs":["N/A"],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C1","frequency_google_ngram":"Relatively low, but increasing due to data security awareness.","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Data-wiping' is a technical term related to data security.

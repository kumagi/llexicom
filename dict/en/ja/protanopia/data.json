This condition is a form of dichromacy, meaning affected individuals have only two functioning types of cone cells instead of the usual three. It is important to differentiate protanopia from other types of color blindness, such as deuteranopia (green color blindness) and tritanopia (blue color blindness), as well as from achromatopsia, which is total color blindness. While there is no cure for protanopia, assistive devices like color-filtering lenses can sometimes improve color discrimination."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"His protanopia made it difficult for him to choose ripe tomatoes at the market.","translation":"彼の第一色盲のせいで、市場で熟したトマトを選ぶのが難しかった。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"condition"},{"sentence":"The protanopia filter helped him differentiate between the red and green wires.","translation":"第一色盲フィルターは、彼が赤と緑のワイヤーを区別するのに役立った。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"characteristic"}]}

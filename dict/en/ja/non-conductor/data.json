It refers to materials that do not easily allow the flow of electricity, heat, or sound. While the concept is relatively straightforward, the term itself is more commonly encountered in scientific or technical discussions rather than everyday conversation. Understanding this term is essential for comprehending basic principles of electricity and heat transfer."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The electrician used a rubber mat as a non-conductor to prevent electric shock.","translation":"電気技師は感電を防ぐためにゴム製のマットを不導体として使用しました。","type":"example","meaning_category":"general"},{"sentence":"Porcelain is often used as a non-conductor in high-voltage applications.","translation":"磁器は高電圧用途で不導体としてよく使用されます。","type":"example","meaning_category":"electrical engineering"},{"sentence":"Fiberglass insulation acts as a non-conductor to reduce heat loss in buildings.","translation":"グラスファイバー断熱材は、建物の熱損失を減らすための不導体として機能します。","type":"example","meaning_category":"thermal engineering"}]}

It's not a common word, and you'll mostly find it in writing that tries to paint a vivid picture of someone or something struggling. For example, you might read about someone walking 'limpingly' after hurting their leg, or a project moving forward 'limpingly' because it lacks resources. It's more advanced vocabulary, so you don't need to use it all the time, but recognizing it can help you understand more complex texts."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"After falling off his bike, he walked limpingly back home.","translation":"自転車から落ちた後、彼は足を引きずって家に戻った。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"physical movement"},{"sentence":"The negotiations proceeded limpingly, with little progress made each day.","translation":"交渉はなかなか進まず、毎日ほとんど進展がなかった。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"figurative progress"}]}

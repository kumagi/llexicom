It describes a state or process that appears to be at its end or in its final form, but is not truly immutable or complete. This term is often used when dealing with asynchronous operations, lazy initialization, or other situations where a value or object is initially set to a provisional 'final' state, with the possibility of further refinement or modification later.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The project is pseudofinally.","correct":"✓ The project is pseudofinally complete.","note":"'Pseudofinally' is an adverb and should modify a verb, adjective, or another adverb, not stand alone as a predicate adjective."},{"incorrect":"✗ The result is finally, but not really.","correct":"✓ The result is pseudofinally computed.","note":"Use 'pseudofinally' to specifically indicate the state is seemingly, but not actually, final."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["pseudo (prefix: false, resembling)","final (adjective: last, ultimate)","finally (adverb: at the end, conclusively)"],"related_concepts":["lazy initialization","asynchronous programming","immutability","state management"],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency.

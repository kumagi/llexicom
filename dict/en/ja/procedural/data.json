In general usage, it refers to the established methods or steps for doing something, often in a formal or official setting. In computer programming, it describes a programming paradigm where programs are structured around procedures or routines (also known as subroutines or functions). It contrasts with other programming paradigms like object-oriented programming.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The process was very procedure.","correct":"✓ The process was very procedural.","note":"'Procedure' is a noun, while 'procedural' is an adjective.

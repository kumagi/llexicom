Opioids are a class of drugs that include powerful pain relievers but carry a risk of addiction and other side effects.

These alternatives can include over-the-counter pain relievers, physical therapy, acupuncture, and other non-pharmacological interventions.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ opioid-free based","correct":"✓ non-opioid-based","note":"The correct term is 'non-opioid-based'.

It's like a lazy or quick way of saying 'uh-huh'. You might hear it in casual conversations, but it's not something you would use in a formal setting like a job interview or when talking to someone you respect a lot. It's important to remember that it's nonstandard, so it's better to use 'yes' or 'uh-huh' in most situations."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"\"Did you finish your homework?\" \"Un-hunh.\"","translation":"「宿題終わった？」「うん。」","type":"interjection","meaning_category":"Affirmation"},{"sentence":"\"Do you want to go to the park?\" \"Un-hunh.\" (said without much enthusiasm)","translation":"「公園に行きたい？」「うん…」（あまり乗り気でない様子で）","type":"interjection","meaning_category":"Reluctant agreement"}]}

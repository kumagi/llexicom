'Dense' can mean tightly packed together (like a dense forest) or difficult to understand (like a dense book). 'Denser' is used to compare two things in terms of how tightly packed or difficult to understand they are. For example, 'This city is denser than that one' means it has more people living in the same area. 'This chapter is denser than the previous one' means it's harder to understand."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The new apartment building made the neighborhood even denser.","translation":"新しいアパートが建ったことで、近隣はさらに密集した。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"より密集した"},{"sentence":"The professor's lecture was denser than the textbook.","translation":"教授の講義は教科書よりも難解だった。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"より理解しにくい"},{"sentence":"The core of the planet is denser than its crust.","translation":"惑星の核は地殻よりも密度が高い。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"より密度の高い"},{"sentence":"The crowd was denser near the stage.","translation":"ステージ付近は群衆がより密集していた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"より密集した"}]}

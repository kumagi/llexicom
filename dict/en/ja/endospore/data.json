They are highly resistant to heat, radiation, chemicals, and desiccation. When conditions become favorable again, the endospore can germinate and return to a vegetative (active and growing) state. Endospores are medically significant because some pathogenic bacteria, such as Bacillus anthracis (anthrax) and Clostridium botulinum (botulism), can form endospores, making them difficult to eradicate.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Endospores are a type of bacteria.","correct":"✓ Endospores are structures formed by certain bacteria.","note":"Endospores are not bacteria themselves, but rather structures formed within bacteria.

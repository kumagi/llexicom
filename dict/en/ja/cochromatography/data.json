It relies on the principle that identical compounds will exhibit identical retention times under the same chromatographic conditions. Therefore, if an unknown substance co-elutes (elutes at the same time) with a known standard, it provides strong evidence for the identity of the unknown. However, it's not definitive proof, and further analysis may be required.","priority":"☆☆☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ co-chromatography","correct":"✓ cochromatography","note":"The term is typically written as one word, without a hyphen."}],"priority":"☆☆☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["chromatography","gas chromatography","liquid chromatography","thin-layer chromatography"],"related_terms":["retention time","elution","standard","analyte"],"priority":"☆☆☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"非常に低頻度 (Very low frequency) - 専門用語","priority":"☆☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C2","text":"Cochromatography is a specialized analytical chemistry technique used to identify substances. It involves running a known standard and an unknown sample through a chromatographic system simultaneously.

This method is particularly useful in fields like forensic science and environmental analysis, but its highly technical nature means it's rarely encountered outside of specialized contexts."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The researchers employed cochromatography to verify the purity of the synthesized peptide.","translation":"研究者たちは、合成されたペプチドの純度を検証するために混合クロマトグラフィーを用いた。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"分析技術"},{"sentence":"Cochromatography, coupled with mass spectrometry, provided conclusive evidence of the compound's structure.","translation":"質量分析法と組み合わせた混合クロマトグラフィーにより、化合物の構造の決定的な証拠が得られた。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"分析技術"}]}

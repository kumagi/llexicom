It is a specialized type of hydrometer, relying on density differences to determine alcohol concentration. It is commonly used in the production of spirits, wines, and beers to ensure quality control and compliance with regulations. The device is relatively simple to use, but requires careful calibration and precise readings to obtain accurate results. Understanding the principle behind its operation requires some knowledge of physics and chemistry.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The brewer carefully checked the wort with an alcoholometer before adding the yeast.","translation":"醸造者は酵母を加える前に、麦汁をアルコールメーターで注意深くチェックした。","type":"general","meaning_category":"measuring"},{"sentence":"To make high-quality vodka, it's crucial to use an alcoholometer during the distillation process.","translation":"高品質のウォッカを作るには、蒸留プロセス中にアルコールメーターを使用することが重要です。","type":"process","meaning_category":"production"},{"sentence":"The alcoholometer indicated that the homemade wine had a higher alcohol content than expected.","translation":"アルコールメーターは、自家製ワインのアルコール度数が予想よりも高いことを示した。","type":"result","meaning_category":"measurement"}]}

It often carries a strongly negative connotation and can be used to describe behaviors, instincts, or even appearances that are considered savage, cruel, or lacking in human refinement. The term is frequently associated with sexual acts involving animals (zoophilia), but its meaning extends beyond this specific context.  It can also refer to violent tendencies, extreme selfishness, or a disregard for morality and compassion. Due to its sensitive nature and potential to cause offense, it's crucial to use the word cautiously and be aware of the implications."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The cruelty he inflicted on the animals was **bestial** in its savagery.","translation":"彼が動物に加えた残虐行為は、その残酷さにおいて野蛮なものだった。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"残酷な, 野蛮な"},{"sentence":"He was accused of **bestial** acts.","translation":"彼は獣姦行為の罪で告発された。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"獣姦的な"},{"sentence":"The novel explored the **bestial** side of human nature, depicting characters driven by primal instincts.","translation":"その小説は、人間の本性の野蛮な側面を探求し、動物的本能に駆り立てられた登場人物を描いた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"動物的な, 本能的な"},{"sentence":"The conditions in the prison were **bestial**, with inmates treated like animals.","translation":"刑務所内の環境は野蛮であり、囚人たちはまるで動物のように扱われていた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"非人間的な, 野蛮な"},{"sentence":"His **bestial** rage consumed him, leading to uncontrollable violence.","translation":"彼の野蛮な怒りが彼を飲み込み、制御不能な暴力につながった。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"猛烈な, 獣のような"}]}

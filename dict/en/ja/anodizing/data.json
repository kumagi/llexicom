This process enhances corrosion resistance, increases surface hardness, and can be used for decorative purposes by adding color. It's important to understand that anodizing is not a coating in the traditional sense, but rather a conversion of the metal's surface into an oxide layer. The process involves immersing the metal in an electrolytic solution and passing an electric current through it, causing the formation of the oxide layer.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The company specializes in the anodizing of aluminum components for the aerospace industry.","translation":"その会社は、航空宇宙産業向けのアルミニウム部品の陽極酸化処理を専門としています。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"陽極酸化処理"},{"sentence":"The bicycle frame was anodized in a vibrant blue color.","translation":"自転車のフレームは鮮やかな青色で陽極酸化処理されました。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"陽極酸化処理する"},{"sentence":"Hard anodizing provides a thicker and more durable oxide layer.","translation":"硬質陽極酸化処理は、より厚く、より耐久性のある酸化皮膜を提供します。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"陽極酸化処理"},{"sentence":"Proper surface preparation is crucial before anodizing.","translation":"陽極酸化処理の前に、適切な表面処理が不可欠です。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"陽極酸化処理"},{"sentence":"The anodized finish is resistant to scratches and wear.","translation":"陽極酸化処理された仕上げは、傷や摩耗に強いです。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"陽極酸化処理された"}]}

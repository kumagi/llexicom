It is a Fourier-related transform similar to the discrete Fourier transform (DFT), but using only real numbers. DCTs are equivalent to DFTs of roughly twice the length, operating on real data with even symmetry (since the Fourier transform of a real and even function is real and even), where in some variants the input and/or output data are shifted by half a sample.","examples":[{"sentence":"DCT is often used in image and video compression.","translation":"DCTは画像やビデオの圧縮によく使われます。"},{"sentence":"The JPEG standard uses DCT to compress images.","translation":"JPEG規格は画像を圧縮するためにDCTを使用します。"}],"collocations":["DCT coefficient","DCT matrix","apply DCT","inverse DCT (IDCT)"],"synonyms":["discrete cosine transform"],"antonyms":[],"related_terms":["DFT","discrete Fourier transform","image compression","video compression","JPEG"]},{"part_of_speech":"noun","definition":"（医学）遠位尿細管 (Distal Convoluted Tubule)","english_definition":"(Medicine) The distal convoluted tubule (DCT) is a portion of kidney nephron between the loop of Henle and the collecting duct system.","examples":[{"sentence":"The DCT plays a key role in regulating electrolyte balance.","translation":"DCTは電解質バランスの調整において重要な役割を果たします。"},{"sentence":"Certain diuretics act on the DCT to increase urine production.","translation":"特定の利尿薬は尿の生成を増加させるためにDCTに作用します。"}],"collocations":["DCT cells","DCT function","affected by DCT"],"synonyms":["distal convoluted tubule"],"antonyms":[]}],"etymology":{"value":"An acronym for Discrete Cosine Transform or Distal Convoluted Tubule.","priority":"★★★"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/ˌdiː siː ˈtiː/","syllables":"dee-see-tee"},"inflection":{"notes":"Plural form is DCTs."},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"DCT has two main meanings: Discrete Cosine Transform and Distal Convoluted Tubule.

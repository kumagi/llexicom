They are characterized by their high content of proline and glutamine. Different cereal grains contain different types of prolamins, such as gliadin in wheat, secalin in rye, hordein in barley, zein in corn, and avenin in oats. These proteins are important for seed development and germination. Some individuals have difficulty digesting prolamins, leading to conditions like celiac disease or gluten sensitivity.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Prolamine is a type of vitamin.","correct":"✓ Prolamin is a type of protein.","note":"Prolamin is a protein, not a vitamin."},{"incorrect":"✗ Prolamins are only found in animal products.","correct":"✓ Prolamins are found in plant seeds, especially cereal grains.","note":"Prolamins are plant-based proteins."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["proline","glutamine","gluten","gliadin","secalin","hordein","zein","avenin"],"phrasal_verbs":[],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Prolamin' is a technical term used in biochemistry and nutrition to refer to a specific type of storage protein found in cereal grains.

This dimensional confinement leads to quantum mechanical effects that alter the material's properties compared to its bulk form. Examples include quantum wells (2D confinement), quantum wires (1D confinement), and quantum dots (0D confinement).","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ dimension restricted","correct":"✓ dimensionally-restricted","note":"The adverbial form 'dimensionally' is required to correctly modify 'restricted'."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["dimensionality","restriction","nanomaterial","nanostructure"],"related_terms":["quantum confinement","nanoscale","two-dimensional material","one-dimensional material","zero-dimensional material"]},"level_frequency":{"level":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Dimensionally-restricted' is a technical term used in advanced scientific contexts, particularly in materials science and nanotechnology.

It is used to describe something that is available as an option. Because it is not a very common word, it is more likely to be found in technical writing or specific contexts where the availability of choices is important to emphasize. It is formed by adding the suffix '-able' to the verb 'choose', which means 'to pick' or 'to select'. In many cases, more common words like 'selectable' or 'available' can be used instead of 'choosable'."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The website offers a list of **choosable** destinations for your vacation.","translation":"そのウェブサイトは、あなたの休暇のための選択可能な目的地のリストを提供しています。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"選択可能な"},{"sentence":"Each character in the game has a unique set of **choosable** skills.","translation":"ゲーム内の各キャラクターは、独自の選択可能なスキルセットを持っています。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"選択可能な"},{"sentence":"The software provides several **choosable** templates for creating presentations.","translation":"そのソフトウェアは、プレゼンテーションを作成するためのいくつかの選択可能なテンプレートを提供します。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"選択可能な"}]}

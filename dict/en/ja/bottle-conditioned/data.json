It indicates that the beverage has undergone a secondary fermentation process inside the bottle. This process is achieved by adding a small amount of yeast and sugar to the bottle before sealing. Over time, the yeast consumes the sugar, producing carbon dioxide (which carbonates the beer or wine) and sediment. This sediment is a natural byproduct of the process and is often considered a sign of quality. When pouring a bottle-conditioned beer, it's recommended to pour carefully to avoid disturbing the sediment, although some people prefer to swirl the last bit to incorporate the sediment for added flavor.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ This beer is bottle conditioned, so it's filtered.","correct":"✓ This beer is bottle conditioned, so it has sediment.","note":"Bottle-conditioned beers are not filtered; the secondary fermentation creates sediment."},{"incorrect":"✗ All bottled beers are bottle-conditioned.","correct":"✓ Not all bottled beers are bottle-conditioned.","note":"Many beers are force-carbonated and filtered before bottling."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["conditioning (noun: the process of improving beer or wine)","secondary fermentation (noun: fermentation that occurs after the primary fermentation)"],"phrasal_verbs":[],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"N/A","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Bottle-conditioned' refers to beer or wine that has undergone a second fermentation inside the bottle.

It describes cells, tissues, or microorganisms that do not readily take up stains or do not produce pigments. The term is often used in contrast to 'chromophilous', which describes cells or tissues that readily take up stains. It's important to note that 'achromophilous' does not mean 'colorless' in the sense of lacking any inherent color, but rather lacking an affinity for applied stains or lacking the ability to produce pigments.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The achromophilous flower was very vibrant.","correct":"✓ The achromophilous flower was white.","note":"Achromophilous means 'not having an affinity for color' or 'not producing pigment', so it would be contradictory to describe something achromophilous as vibrant.

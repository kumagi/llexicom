It suggests a degree of cunning or subtlety in the approach. The word is not very common, and its use can sometimes sound awkward or overly deliberate. More common alternatives include 'indirectly', 'subtly', or using a phrasal verb like 'fishing for'.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ He fishingly caught a fish.","correct":"✓ He caught a fish while fishing.","note":"'Fishingly' is an adverb describing *how* someone acts, not *what* they catch.

Because it's not a common word, it's best used in contexts where the subtlety and indirectness are important to convey. It's more common to use phrases like 'indirectly' or 'subtly' to express the same idea."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The journalist questioned the politician fishingly about the rumors.","translation":"ジャーナリストは政治家に噂についてそれとなく質問した。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"indirectly questioning"},{"sentence":"She glanced at the gift fishingly, hoping to get a hint about its contents.","translation":"彼女は贈り物の中身についてそれとなくヒントを得ようと、贈り物をちらっと見た。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"subtly seeking information"},{"sentence":"He approached the subject fishingly, not wanting to be too direct.","translation":"彼は直接的になりたくなかったので、その話題にそれとなく近づいた。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"indirectly approaching"}]}

It is used to describe sedimentary rocks that are not formed from the accumulation and cementation of broken fragments (clasts) of pre-existing rocks or organic remains. Instead, nonclastic rocks form through direct chemical precipitation or biogenic activity. Understanding this term requires a background in geology or earth science. Examples include limestone formed from the precipitation of calcium carbonate and evaporites formed from the evaporation of water and precipitation of dissolved minerals.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The Permian Basin is known for its deposits of both clastic and nonclastic sedimentary rocks.","translation":"ペルム紀盆地は、砕屑性および非砕屑性堆積岩の両方の堆積物で知られています。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"geology"},{"sentence":"Chalk is a type of nonclastic sedimentary rock composed mainly of the skeletal remains of marine microorganisms.","translation":"チョークは、主に海洋微生物の骨格遺骸で構成される非砕屑性堆積岩の一種です。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"geology"}]}

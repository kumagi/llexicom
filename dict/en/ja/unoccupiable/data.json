It's formed by adding the prefix 'un-' to 'occupiable,' which means 'able to be occupied.' The word is typically used in formal contexts, such as legal or official reports, to describe buildings or land that are unsafe or unsuitable for habitation or use due to damage, contamination, or other issues. Understanding the meaning of 'occupy' and the negative prefix 'un-' helps in deciphering the meaning of 'unoccupiable.'"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The earthquake rendered several buildings in the city unoccupiable.","translation":"地震により、市内のいくつかの建物が居住不可能になった。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"居住できない"},{"sentence":"The contaminated land was declared unoccupiable by the environmental agency.","translation":"汚染された土地は、環境機関によって占有できないと宣言された。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"占有できない"},{"sentence":"The old shack was clearly unoccupiable, with holes in the roof and walls.","translation":"その古い小屋は、屋根や壁に穴が開いており、明らかに居住不可能だった。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"居住できない"}]}

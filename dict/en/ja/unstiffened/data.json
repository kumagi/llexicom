It describes something that hasn't been made rigid or firm by adding extra supports. For example, an 'unstiffened panel' is a flat piece of material that doesn't have extra bars or frames to stop it from bending or collapsing under pressure. This word is most often found in specialist texts about building or designing things.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The analysis focused on the behavior of the unstiffened shell.","translation":"その解析は、補剛されていないシェルの挙動に焦点を当てた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"technical"},{"sentence":"The unstiffened wing design reduced the aircraft's weight.","translation":"補剛されていない翼の設計は、航空機の重量を軽減した。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"technical"}]}

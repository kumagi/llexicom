It refers to systems or models that are composed of multiple autonomous agents that interact with each other and their environment. These agents typically have their own goals, behaviors, and decision-making capabilities. Agent-based models are often used to simulate complex systems where the behavior of the system emerges from the interactions of the individual agents.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ We used a agent based model.","correct":"✓ We used an agent-based model.","note":"'Agent' starts with a vowel sound, so the indefinite article 'an' should be used."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["agent","agent-oriented","multi-agent"],"related_terms":["agent-based modeling (ABM)","agent-based simulation (ABS)","artificial intelligence (AI)","complex systems","emergent behavior"],"priority":"★★★"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C1","frequency_google_ngram":"Relatively low frequency, but increasing in specific fields.","priority":"★★☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Agent-based' is a technical term used in computer science, modeling, and simulation.

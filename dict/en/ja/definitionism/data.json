It assumes that ambiguity and vagueness are detrimental to clear thinking and effective communication. However, it faces criticism for potentially oversimplifying complex ideas and for failing to account for the inherent ambiguity in some concepts. It is often associated with analytic philosophy and logical positivism.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Definitionism is the belief that all definitions are true.","correct":"✓ Definitionism is the belief that clear definitions are essential for understanding concepts.","note":"Definitionism is not about the truth of definitions, but about their importance for clarity."}],"priority":"★☆☆"},"level_frequency":{"frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency - Primarily used in philosophical contexts.","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"Definitionism is a term used in philosophy to describe the belief that understanding ideas and theories relies on having very clear and exact definitions for the words and concepts involved. It's like saying you can't build a strong building without first having a precise blueprint. However, some philosophers argue that not all ideas can be perfectly defined, and trying to force them into rigid definitions can actually make them harder to understand. This term is mainly used when discussing philosophical approaches to knowledge and meaning."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The project failed because of the team's commitment to definitionism; they spent too much time arguing over the precise meaning of terms.","translation":"そのプロジェクトは、チームが定義主義に固執したために失敗した。彼らは用語の正確な意味について議論するのに時間を費やしすぎた。","type":"general","meaning_category":"philosophical approach"},{"sentence":"Definitionism in legal theory seeks to eliminate ambiguity in laws through precise wording.","translation":"法理論における定義主義は、正確な文言によって法律の曖昧さを排除しようとする。","type":"specific","meaning_category":"legal theory"}]}

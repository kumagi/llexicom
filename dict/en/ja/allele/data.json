Each individual typically inherits two alleles for each gene, one from each parent. These alleles determine the individual's traits. If the two alleles are the same, the individual is homozygous for that gene; if they are different, the individual is heterozygous. Dominant alleles express their trait even when paired with a recessive allele, while recessive alleles only express their trait when paired with another recessive allele.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The allele is on the chromosome.","correct":"✓ The allele is located at a specific locus on the chromosome.","note":"Alleles occupy specific locations (loci) on chromosomes.

Genes determine traits like eye color or height. Most organisms have two alleles for each gene, one from each parent. These alleles can be the same or different. If they are different, one allele might be dominant and determine the trait, while the other is recessive. Understanding alleles is important for understanding how traits are inherited.

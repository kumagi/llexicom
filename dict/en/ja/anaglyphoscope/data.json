The viewer wears glasses with corresponding color filters, one for each eye, so that each eye sees a slightly different image. The brain then combines these two images to create the illusion of depth. This is one of the oldest methods of creating a stereoscopic 3D effect.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ I used binoculars to see the anaglyph.","correct":"✓ I used an anaglyphoscope to see the anaglyph.","note":"Binoculars are for magnifying distant objects, while an anaglyphoscope is specifically for viewing anaglyph 3D images."},{"incorrect":"✗ The anaglyphoscope showed a very clear picture without any color distortion.","correct":"✓ Anaglyphoscopes inherently have some color distortion due to the color filters.","note":"Anaglyph 3D relies on color filters, which inevitably cause some color distortion.

An anaglyph is a composite image made of two color-filtered layers, usually red and cyan. The anaglyphoscope has corresponding color filters for each eye, allowing each eye to see a slightly different image, which the brain then interprets as a 3D scene. This technology is relatively old but still used in some contexts. Understanding the term requires familiarity with stereoscopic imaging and the specific technique of anaglyphy.","priority":"★☆☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The old movie was presented in anaglyph 3D, requiring the use of an anaglyphoscope.","translation":"その古い映画はアナグリフ3Dで上映され、アナグリフスコープの使用が必要でした。","type":"general","meaning_category":"definition"},{"sentence":"Children often enjoy using an anaglyphoscope to view 3D comic books.","translation":"子供たちはアナグリフスコープを使って3Dコミックを見るのを楽しむことが多いです。","type":"general","meaning_category":"definition"}]}

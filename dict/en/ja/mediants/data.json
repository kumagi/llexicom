It's important to note that the mediant does not behave like standard averaging. The mediant always lies between the two original fractions, but it is not necessarily the average of the two fractions.","priority":"☆☆☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"The mediant is the average of two fractions.","correct":"The mediant is not the average of two fractions; it is (a+c)/(b+d).","note":"The mediant is calculated differently from the average.

It indicates that something has already been described or presented in a general or summary form.

You'll usually see 'outlain' used in formal writing when something has already been described briefly. For example, 'The steps to complete the task were outlain in the manual.' This means the manual gave a general description of the steps, but not all the details. It's not a very common word, so you'll mostly find it in more advanced texts."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The procedure is outlain in detail in Appendix A.","translation":"手順は付録Aに詳細に概説されている。","type":"verb (past participle)","meaning_category":"概説された"},{"sentence":"The basic principles are outlain below for your convenience.","translation":"基本的な原則は便宜のために以下に概説されている。","type":"verb (past participle)","meaning_category":"概説された"},{"sentence":"The responsibilities of each team member were clearly outlain.","translation":"各チームメンバーの責任は明確に概説されていた。","type":"verb (past participle)","meaning_category":"概説された"}]}

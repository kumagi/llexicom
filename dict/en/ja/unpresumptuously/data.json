It is formed by adding the prefix 'un-' (meaning 'not') and the suffix '-ly' (turning it into an adverb) to the adjective 'presumptuous'. To understand 'unpresumptuously', one must first understand 'presumptuous', which means behaving with undue boldness or making assumptions without proper authority. Therefore, 'unpresumptuously' means behaving modestly and without unwarranted assumptions, often in situations where one might be tempted to act boastfully or self-importantly. This word is relatively rare and more likely to be encountered in formal writing or sophisticated conversation."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The scientist unpresumptuously presented his groundbreaking research, focusing on the collaborative effort behind the discovery.","translation":"その科学者は控えめに画期的な研究を発表し、発見の背後にある共同の努力に焦点を当てました。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"modestly"},{"sentence":"She unpresumptuously accepted the compliment, attributing her success to hard work and dedication.","translation":"彼女は謙虚に賛辞を受け入れ、成功は努力と献身のおかげだと述べました。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"humbly"},{"sentence":"He unpresumptuously shared his expertise, always willing to help others without seeking recognition.","translation":"彼は出しゃばらずに専門知識を共有し、常に認識を求めることなく他人を助けることを厭いませんでした。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"unassumingly"}]}

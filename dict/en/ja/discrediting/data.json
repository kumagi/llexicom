It combines the prefix 'dis-' (meaning 'not' or 'opposite of') with 'credit,' derived from the Old Italian 'credito' (trust, belief) and ultimately from the Latin 'credere' (to believe). Thus, 'discredit' literally means 'to not believe' or 'to remove belief or trust.'","priority":"★★★"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/dɪˈskredɪtɪŋ/","syllables":"dis-cred-it-ing"},"inflection":{"notes":"'Discrediting' is the gerund or present participle form of the verb 'discredit.'

This Arabic term is believed to have originated from the ancient Greek word 'khēmeia' (χημεία), referring to the art of transmuting metals, particularly into gold, and also associated with Egyptian practices. The suffix '-izing' turns the noun 'alchemy' into a verb, indicating the process or act of performing alchemy.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/ˈælkəmaɪzɪŋ/","syllables":"al-che-mi-zing"},"inflection":{"verb_forms":{"present_simple":["alchemizes"],"past_simple":"alchemized","past_participle":"alchemized","present_participle":"alchemizing"}},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Alchemizing' is primarily used in two contexts: literally, referring to the historical practice of alchemy, and metaphorically, to describe a process of profound transformation or conversion.

Metaphorically, it describes turning something ordinary or undesirable into something valuable or extraordinary.

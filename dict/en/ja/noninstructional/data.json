It is often used in the context of schools or educational institutions to refer to activities, materials, or staff that are not directly involved in the process of instruction. For example, a school might have noninstructional staff who handle administrative tasks, or noninstructional time that is used for planning or meetings. The word is formed by adding the prefix \"non-\" to the word \"instructional,\" which means \"related to teaching.\" Because of its specific and somewhat technical meaning, \"noninstructional\" is not a very common word in everyday conversation, but it is useful to know in the context of education."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The teacher used **noninstructional** time to grade papers.","translation":"先生は教育的でない時間を使って、答案を採点した。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"教育的でない"},{"sentence":"The school board discussed the allocation of resources for both instructional and **noninstructional** purposes.","translation":"教育委員会は、教育目的と教育的でない目的の両方への資源配分について議論した。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"教育的でない"},{"sentence":"The **noninstructional** staff members are essential to the smooth operation of the school.","translation":"教育的でないスタッフメンバーは、学校の円滑な運営に不可欠です。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"教育的でない"}]}

It suggests that someone is acting or behaving in a way that is meant to deceive others into thinking that something is true when it is not. Because of its formality and relatively low frequency, it is more likely to be encountered in written texts than in everyday conversation. A simpler way to express the same idea might be to say 'falsely' or 'insincerely'."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"He pretendedly showed concern for her situation, but everyone knew he was just trying to gain favor.","translation":"彼は見せかけだけ彼女の状況を気にかけていたが、彼がただ単に有利になろうとしているだけだと誰もが知っていた。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"insincerely"},{"sentence":"She pretendedly accepted the apology, though she was still hurt.","translation":"彼女はまだ傷ついていたが、見せかけだけ謝罪を受け入れた。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"falsely"},{"sentence":"The politician pretendedly championed the cause of the poor, but his policies benefited the wealthy.","translation":"その政治家は見せかけだけ貧困層の擁護をしたが、彼の政策は富裕層に利益をもたらした。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"hypocritically"}]}

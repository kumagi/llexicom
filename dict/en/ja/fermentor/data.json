These processes are used in a variety of industries, including brewing, winemaking, pharmaceuticals, and food production. Fermentors can range in size from small laboratory-scale vessels to large industrial tanks. Key features often include temperature control, pH control, aeration systems, and agitation mechanisms to ensure optimal conditions for the microorganisms or enzymes involved in the fermentation.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ He used a fermentation to make beer.","correct":"✓ He used a fermentor to make beer.","note":"'Fermentation' is the process, while 'fermentor' is the equipment used for the process."},{"incorrect":"✗ The fermentor was fermenting.","correct":"✓ The culture was fermenting in the fermentor.","note":"The fermentor is the container.

They contain a network of ribosomal RNA, which disappears as the cell matures into a fully functional red blood cell. The number of neocytes in the blood is used as an indicator of the rate of red blood cell production. An elevated neocyte count may indicate conditions such as anemia or blood loss, where the body is trying to compensate by producing more red blood cells.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Neocytes are white blood cells.","correct":"✓ Neocytes are red blood cells.","note":"Neocytes are a type of red blood cell, not white blood cells."},{"incorrect":"✗ Neocytes are fully mature red blood cells.","correct":"✓ Neocytes are immature red blood cells.","note":"Neocytes are newly formed, immature red blood cells."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["neo- (prefix meaning new)","-cyte (suffix meaning cell)"],"phrasal_verbs":[],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency.

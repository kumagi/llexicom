Many statistical tests assume that the data are normally distributed, and violations of this assumption can lead to inaccurate results. Tests like the Shapiro-Wilk test and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test are used to assess whether data are normally distributed. If nonnormality is detected, transformations (e.g., logarithmic, square root) can sometimes be applied to the data to make it more closely resemble a normal distribution. Alternatively, non-parametric statistical tests, which do not assume normality, can be used.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The data has non normality.","correct":"✓ The data has nonnormality.","note":"'Nonnormality' is a noun and should be used as such.

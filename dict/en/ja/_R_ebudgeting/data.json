It's a term commonly used in business and finance contexts. To understand it, you need to know what 'budgeting' means first, which is the process of creating a plan for how money will be spent. The prefix 're-' indicates that this process is being done again or revised. Therefore, 'rebudgeting' means to adjust or change a budget that has already been created. It's a more advanced term, so it's typically used by those who are familiar with financial planning and management."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The company decided on **rebudgeting** after sales fell short of projections.","translation":"売上高が予測を下回ったため、会社は予算の見直しを決定した。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"予算の見直し"},{"sentence":"The department is **rebudgeting** its resources to focus on the most critical projects.","translation":"部門は、最も重要なプロジェクトに焦点を当てるために、リソースの予算を再編成している。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"予算を再編成する"},{"sentence":"The **rebudgeting** process involved a thorough review of all expenses.","translation":"予算の見直しプロセスには、すべての費用の徹底的な見直しが含まれていた。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"予算の見直し"}]}

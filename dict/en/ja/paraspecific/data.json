These antibodies can bind to multiple, structurally similar antigens, leading to cross-reactivity.

It describes something that is similar to being specific but isn't completely so. In other words, it refers to antibodies or reactions that can bind to more than one target, showing a lower level of precision compared to highly specific interactions. This term is likely encountered in advanced scientific literature or discussions related to immune responses and diagnostics."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The study investigated the paraspecific binding of the antibody to different viral proteins.","translation":"その研究では、その抗体の異なるウイルス蛋白質へのパラ特異的な結合が調査された。","type":"scientific","meaning_category":"immunology"},{"sentence":"The observed paraspecificity may explain the cross-reactivity seen in some serological assays.","translation":"観察されたパラ特異性は、いくつかの血清学的アッセイで見られる交差反応性を説明するかもしれない。","type":"scientific","meaning_category":"immunology"}]}

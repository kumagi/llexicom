If you have a function that maps elements from one set (the domain) to another set (the codomain), the preimage of a specific element in the codomain is the set of all elements in the domain that the function maps to that specific element. It's like asking, 'What things go in to give me this thing out?' This is different from the 'image,' which is the result you get when you apply the function to an element in the domain.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"Find the preimage of the set {4, 9} under the function f(x) = x^2.","translation":"関数 f(x) = x^2 の下での集合 {4, 9} の原像を求めよ。","type":"example","meaning_category":"mathematics"},{"sentence":"The preimage of a point may be empty if no element in the domain maps to it.","translation":"定義域のどの要素も写像されない場合、点の原像は空集合になることがある。","type":"example","meaning_category":"mathematics"}]}

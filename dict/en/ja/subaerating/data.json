Thus, 'subaerial' refers to environments or processes occurring on or near the Earth's surface, exposed to the air. 'Subaerating' is the gerund or present participle form of the verb 'subaerate,' meaning to expose to the air or to cause aeration in such an environment.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/sʌbˈɛəreɪtɪŋ/","syllables":"sub-a-er-a-ting"},"inflection":{"verb_forms":{"present_simple":["subaerates"],"past_simple":"subaerated","past_participle":"subaerated","present_participle":"subaerating"}},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Subaerating' is a technical term primarily used in geology, soil science, and environmental science. It describes the process of exposing something, typically soil or sediment, to the air. This exposure facilitates aeration, which can affect various chemical and biological processes within the material.

It means that the way the software is being developed is heavily influenced by regression testing. Regression testing is when you re-run tests on existing features after making changes to the code, to make sure the changes haven't broken anything that used to work. So, if a project is 'regression-driven', it means the developers are very focused on making sure they don't accidentally introduce new bugs or problems while adding new features or fixing old ones. This approach prioritizes stability and reliability."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The company's commitment to a regression-driven strategy resulted in a more stable and reliable product.","translation":"会社のリグレッションテスト駆動戦略へのコミットメントは、より安定した信頼性の高い製品をもたらしました。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"Software Development"},{"sentence":"By using a regression-driven approach, the team was able to identify and fix critical bugs before the software was released.","translation":"リグレッションテスト駆動型のアプローチを使用することで、チームはソフトウェアがリリースされる前に重大なバグを特定して修正することができました。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"Software Development"}]}

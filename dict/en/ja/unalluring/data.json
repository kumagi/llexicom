It's formed by adding the prefix 'un-' to 'alluring,' which means 'attractive or tempting.' The word is used to describe something that fails to entice or draw someone in. Because it's less common, it's more suitable for advanced English learners who want to expand their vocabulary. It's often used in formal writing or when a more nuanced description is needed than simply saying something is 'unattractive.'"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The grey skies and constant rain made the city seem unalluring.","translation":"どんよりとした空と降り続く雨のせいで、その都市は魅力がないように見えた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"魅力的でない"},{"sentence":"The job offer, with its long hours and low pay, was decidedly unalluring.","translation":"長時間労働と低賃金のその仕事のオファーは、明らかに魅力的ではなかった。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"魅力的でない"},{"sentence":"The unalluring food in the cafeteria led many students to pack their own lunches.","translation":"カフェテリアの魅力のない食べ物のせいで、多くの生徒が自分で弁当を持ってくるようになった。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"魅力的でない"}]}

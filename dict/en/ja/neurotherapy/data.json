During a neurotherapy session, sensors are placed on the scalp to monitor brainwaves. The individual receives feedback (e.g., visual or auditory) based on their brainwave activity, which they then use to learn how to modify their brainwave patterns. The goal is to improve cognitive function, emotional regulation, and behavior. It is used to treat a variety of conditions, including ADHD, anxiety, depression, autism spectrum disorder, and traumatic brain injury.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Neurotherapy is a drug.","correct":"✓ Neurotherapy is a type of therapy.","note":"Neurotherapy is a non-pharmacological treatment; it does not involve medication."},{"incorrect":"✗ Neurotherapy is the same as psychotherapy.","correct":"✓ Neurotherapy is different from psychotherapy.","note":"Neurotherapy focuses on brainwave activity, while psychotherapy focuses on thoughts, feelings, and behaviors."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["neurotherapist"],"phrasal_verbs":[],"related_terms":["biofeedback","EEG","brainwave","neurofeedback"],"priority":"★★★"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C1","frequency_google_ngram":"低頻度 (Low frequency) - 専門用語","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"Neurotherapy is a specialized term related to a specific type of therapy that aims to improve brain function through brainwave monitoring and feedback.

This is different from simple reflection, where light bounces off at an angle. Retroreflective materials are commonly used in safety applications, such as road signs, clothing, and vehicle markings, to enhance visibility in low-light conditions.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The sign was retroreflecting the light.","correct":"✓ The sign was retroreflective.","note":"\"Retroreflective\" is an adjective, not a verb.

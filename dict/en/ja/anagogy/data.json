It is one of the four senses of Scripture recognized in medieval theology: literal, allegorical, moral (or tropological), and anagogical. The anagogical sense focuses on eschatological matters, such as heaven, hell, judgment, and the ultimate destiny of humanity. Outside of theology, the term can be used more broadly to describe any interpretation that elevates the mind to spiritual or higher-level understanding. It is often contrasted with more literal or historical interpretations.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ He used anagogy to prove his scientific theory.","correct":"✓ He used allegory to explain his scientific theory.","note":"Anagogy is specific to theological or spiritual interpretations, not scientific theories.

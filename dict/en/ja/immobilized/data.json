It's often used when talking about injuries, like a broken arm being put in a cast to keep it still. It can also describe something being stopped from working or being used, like a car that's been stopped by the police. The word comes from 'mobile,' which means able to move, and the prefix 'im-' which means 'not.' So, 'immobilized' is the opposite of 'mobile.'"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The thief immobilized the security camera by cutting the wires.","translation":"泥棒は配線を切断して防犯カメラを動けなくした。","type":"verb (past participle)","meaning_category":"動けなくする"},{"sentence":"After the surgery, her arm was immobilized in a sling.","translation":"手術後、彼女の腕はスリングで固定された。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"固定された"},{"sentence":"The protesters successfully immobilized traffic in the city center.","translation":"抗議者たちは都心部の交通を封鎖することに成功した。","type":"verb (past participle)","meaning_category":"封じ込める"}]}

It's the opposite of 'neoplastic,' which means related to a tumor or cancer. This term is mainly used by doctors and scientists when talking about diseases and conditions. If a doctor says a growth is 'non-neoplastic,' it means it's not cancerous and doesn't involve the abnormal growth of cells that characterizes tumors. Understanding this term requires some background knowledge of medical terminology.

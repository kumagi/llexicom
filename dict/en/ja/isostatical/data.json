It describes something related to 'isostasy,' which is the equilibrium between the Earth's crust and mantle. This equilibrium is maintained by the buoyancy of the crust floating on the denser mantle. The word is typically encountered in academic or professional contexts dealing with the Earth's structure and dynamics."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The region experienced significant isostatical rebound after the glacier melted.","translation":"氷河が溶けた後、その地域は著しい地殻均衡反発を経験した。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"地殻均衡の"},{"sentence":"Understanding isostatical principles is crucial for interpreting geological formations.","translation":"地殻均衡の原理を理解することは、地質学的構造を解釈する上で重要である。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"地殻均衡の"}]}

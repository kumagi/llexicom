This linkage can prevent recombination between the genes, allowing specific combinations of alleles to be maintained over generations. Supergenes are often involved in controlling complex traits, such as mimicry in butterflies or social behavior in ants.","priority":"☆☆☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The supergene is a single allele.","correct":"✓ The supergene is a cluster of linked genes.","note":"A supergene is not a single allele but a group of genes.

It is a measure of the horizontal temperature gradient and is related to the generation of vorticity (rotation) in fluids. High baroclinity is often associated with unstable atmospheric conditions and the formation of weather systems. The opposite of baroclinity is barotropy, where surfaces of constant density and pressure are parallel.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The atmosphere is barotropic, leading to cyclone development.","correct":"✓ The atmosphere is baroclinic, leading to cyclone development.","note":"Baroclinity, not barotropy, is associated with cyclone development."}],"priority":"★☆☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["baroclinic (adjective: 傾圧性の)","baroclinically (adverb: 傾圧的に)"],"phrasal_verbs":null,"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2 (専門的な気象学または海洋学の文脈でのみ使用)","frequency_google_ngram":"非常に低頻度 (Very low frequency) - 専門用語","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Baroclinity' is a technical term used in meteorology and oceanography to describe a state where surfaces of constant density and pressure are not parallel.

This allows for a more accurate comparison of values across different time periods, as it reflects the real purchasing power of the money. Without inflation adjustment, comparing nominal values can be misleading because inflation erodes the value of money over time.

Inflation is the general increase in prices over time, which reduces the purchasing power of money. When we say something is 'inflation-adjusted', it means we have recalculated the value to show what it would be worth in today's money (or some other base year). This is important for comparing amounts from different years. For example, comparing salaries from 1980 and 2020 is more meaningful if you use inflation-adjusted figures, as it shows the real change in purchasing power, not just the nominal change in the number of dollars."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The inflation-adjusted cost of the project was higher than initially estimated.","translation":"そのプロジェクトのインフレ調整後のコストは、当初の見積もりよりも高かった。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"economic analysis"},{"sentence":"Retirees often worry about the inflation-adjusted value of their pensions.","translation":"退職者は、年金のインフレ調整後の価値について心配することがよくあります。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"finance"},{"sentence":"Economists use inflation-adjusted data to analyze long-term economic trends.","translation":"経済学者は、長期的な経済動向を分析するために、インフレ調整済みのデータを使用します。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"economics"}]}

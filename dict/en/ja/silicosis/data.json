Over time, this exposure leads to scarring (fibrosis) of the lungs, reducing their ability to function properly. Symptoms often develop slowly, starting with shortness of breath and cough, eventually progressing to more severe respiratory problems. There are different types – chronic, accelerated, and acute – depending on the length and intensity of exposure.  It is an occupational hazard in industries like mining, construction, sandblasting, and glass manufacturing. Prevention involves dust control measures and the use of respirators."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"Miners are at high risk of developing **silicosis** due to prolonged exposure to silica dust.","translation":"鉱夫は、長期間の二酸化ケイ素粉塵への曝露により、珪肺を発症するリスクが高い。","type":"medical context","meaning_category":"disease risk"},{"sentence":"The factory implemented new safety protocols to prevent **silicosis** among its workers.","translation":"工場は、労働者の珪肺を防止するために新しい安全プロトコルを実施した。","type":"medical context","meaning_category":"disease prevention"},{"sentence":"Symptoms of **silicosis** can include persistent cough, shortness of breath, and fatigue.","translation":"珪肺の症状には、持続的な咳、息切れ、疲労などがあります。","type":"medical context","meaning_category":"disease symptoms"}]}

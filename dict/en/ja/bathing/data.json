As a noun, it often describes the act itself, while as a verb (present participle of 'bathe'), it describes the ongoing action. The context usually clarifies whether it refers to taking a bath, swimming in the sea, or washing someone or something else. It is less formal than 'ablution' and more specific than 'washing.'","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ I like to go to bathing every day.","correct":"✓ I like to go bathing every day.","note":"'Bathing' is used as a gerund (a verb acting as a noun) here, so it doesn't need 'to' before it.

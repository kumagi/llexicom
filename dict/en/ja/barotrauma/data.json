It is most commonly associated with diving and air travel, but can also occur in other situations where there are rapid changes in pressure. The ears and sinuses are particularly vulnerable, but the lungs, teeth, and even the brain can be affected.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ He got a barotrauma from the loud music.","correct":"✓ He experienced hearing damage from the loud music.","note":"Barotrauma is caused by pressure differences, not sound intensity.

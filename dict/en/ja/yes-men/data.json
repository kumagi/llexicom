It is a straightforward compound word derived from the phrase 'yes man,' referring to someone who habitually says 'yes' to everything their superior suggests, regardless of their own beliefs or the merits of the suggestion. The plural form, 'yes-men,' simply extends this concept to multiple individuals.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/ˈjɛsˌmɛn/","syllables":"yes-men"},"inflection":{"noun_plural":"yes-men (already plural)"},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"The term 'yes-men' is almost always used in a negative or critical context.

It refers to the condition where an organism has multiple sets of chromosomes, with each set originating from a different species. This is a relatively advanced concept, primarily discussed in the context of plant genetics and evolution. Understanding requires familiarity with basic genetics terminology such as diploid, polyploid, and species hybridization."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"Wheat is an example of a plant that has undergone **amphiploidy** during its evolution.","translation":"小麦は、進化の過程で異質倍数性を経験した植物の一例です。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"genetics"},{"sentence":"Induced **amphiploidy** can be a useful tool for plant breeders to create new crop varieties.","translation":"人為的な異質倍数性の誘導は、植物育種家が新しい作物品種を作り出すための有用なツールとなりえます。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"genetics"}]}

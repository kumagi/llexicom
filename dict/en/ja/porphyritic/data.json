It indicates that the rock contains larger, well-formed crystals (phenocrysts) embedded in a finer-grained matrix. This texture is indicative of a specific cooling history where the rock initially cooled slowly at depth, allowing large crystals to grow, followed by a more rapid cooling at or near the surface, which resulted in the fine-grained matrix. The term can be used metaphorically to describe something with contrasting elements or qualities.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The porphyritic rock was smooth and uniform.","correct":"✓ The porphyritic rock had a mix of large and small crystals.","note":"Porphyritic rocks, by definition, have a mix of crystal sizes, not a uniform texture."}],"priority":"★☆☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["porphyry (noun)","porphyritically (adverb)"],"phrasal_verbs":[],"related_terms":["phenocryst","matrix (geology)","igneous rock","volcanic rock","plutonic rock"]},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency.

It involves the change in surface tension (or interfacial tension) as a function of the applied electric potential. The electrocapillarity curve is a plot of the surface tension versus the applied potential, which typically shows a maximum. This phenomenon is used in various applications, including sensors, microfluidics, and energy storage.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["electrocapillary (adjective)"],"phrasal_verbs":[]},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C2","text":"Electrocapillarity is a scientific term used in physical chemistry and electrochemistry.

This sheath acts as an insulator, allowing for faster and more efficient transmission of electrical signals along the nerve fiber. The presence or absence of myelination is a key factor in determining the speed of nerve impulse conduction.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The brain is made of mostly myelinated cells.","correct":"✓ The brain is made of mostly myelinated nerve fibers/axons.","note":"'Myelinated' specifically refers to nerve fibers (axons), not cells in general."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["myelin (noun)","myelination (noun)","myelinate (verb)","unmyelinated (adjective)"],"priority":"★★★"},"level_frequency":{"level":"Specialized (Medical/Biological)","frequency_google_ngram":"Low to medium frequency, primarily in scientific and medical contexts.","priority":"★★☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Myelinated' is a technical term used in biology and medicine, specifically in the context of nerve fibers.

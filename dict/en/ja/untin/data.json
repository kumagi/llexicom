It's not a word you'll encounter frequently, so it's more useful for specialized contexts. It's formed by adding the prefix \"un-\" to \"tin,\" indicating the reversal of the action. Be aware that more common alternatives like \"open\" are usually preferred for general use. The word is more common in British English.

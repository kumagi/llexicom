This path remains in place for the duration of the communication, guaranteeing bandwidth and quality of service. This is in contrast to 'packet-switched' networks, where data is broken into packets that may travel different routes and be reassembled at the destination. Circuit switching is typically used for real-time communication like voice calls.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The internet is circuit-switched.","correct":"✓ The internet is packet-switched.","note":"The internet primarily uses packet switching, not circuit switching."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":[],"related_concepts":["packet switching","networking","telecommunications","bandwidth","quality of service (QoS)"],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C1","frequency_google_ngram":"Low","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Circuit-switched' is a technical term used in telecommunications and networking.

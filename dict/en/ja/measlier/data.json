'Measly' itself means small, inadequate, or contemptible. Therefore, 'measlier' is used to compare two things, indicating that one is even smaller, more inadequate, or more contemptible than the other. It's not a common word, so it's more likely to be encountered in formal writing or when someone wants to express strong dissatisfaction with something's size or quality."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"His second attempt was even measlier than the first.","translation":"彼の二度目の試みは、一度目よりもさらに見劣りするものだった。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"more inadequate"},{"sentence":"The company offered a measlier bonus this year compared to last year.","translation":"会社は今年、昨年と比べてよりわずかなボーナスを提示した。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"smaller"},{"sentence":"The measlier portion of cake was given to the child who misbehaved.","translation":"より見劣りのするケーキの分け前は、行儀の悪かった子供に与えられた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"inferior"}]}

It describes the process by which small particles in a liquid solution aggregate to form larger clumps called flocs. This process is often induced by adding a chemical agent (a flocculant) to the solution. The resulting flocs can then be more easily removed through sedimentation or filtration. Understanding this term requires familiarity with scientific concepts related to suspensions, solutions, and particle behavior."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The sewage sludge was **flocculating** rapidly after the addition of the polymer.","translation":"ポリマーの添加後、下水汚泥は急速に凝集していた。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"凝集する"},{"sentence":"The chemical plant is **flocculating** the wastewater to remove pollutants.","translation":"化学工場は汚染物質を除去するために廃水を凝集させている。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"凝集させる"},{"sentence":"The **flocculating** agent helped to clarify the turbid water.","translation":"凝集剤は濁った水を浄化するのに役立った。","type":"adjective (as part of a noun phrase)","meaning_category":"凝集させる"}]}

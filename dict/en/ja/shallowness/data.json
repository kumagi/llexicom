The origin of 'schalowe' is uncertain, but it's possibly related to Old English 'sceald' meaning 'shoal' or 'shallow place in water'. The suffix '-ness' is added to 'shallow' to form the noun 'shallowness', indicating the state or quality of being shallow.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/ˈʃæloʊnəs/","syllables":"shal-low-ness"},"inflection":{"noun_plural":"shallownesses (rarely used)"},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Shallowness' is a noun that describes the quality of being shallow, both literally (lacking physical depth) and figuratively (lacking intellectual or emotional depth).

This can refer to physical depth, like the 'shallowness' of a puddle, or to a lack of intellectual or emotional depth, like the 'shallowness' of a person's ideas.

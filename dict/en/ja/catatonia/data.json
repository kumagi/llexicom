It is most commonly associated with schizophrenia but can also occur in other psychiatric disorders, medical conditions, and substance-induced states. The presentation of catatonia is highly variable, ranging from marked motor retardation (stupor) to excessive motor activity (agitation). Other common features include mutism, negativism, posturing, waxy flexibility, echolalia, and echopraxia. Diagnosis is based on clinical observation and standardized rating scales. Treatment typically involves benzodiazepines and/or electroconvulsive therapy (ECT).","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ He is catatonic.","correct":"✓ He is in a catatonic state. / ✓ He has catatonia.","note":"'Catatonic' is an adjective, but it's more common to say 'in a catatonic state' or 'has catatonia' rather than directly using 'catatonic' to describe a person."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["catatonic (adjective)"],"phrasal_verbs":[]},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Catatonia' is a technical term used in psychiatry to describe a state of motor and behavioral disturbance.

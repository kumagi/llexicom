It refers to the breakdown of complex carbohydrates, such as starch or cellulose, into simpler sugars like glucose, fructose, or maltose. This process can be achieved through enzymatic hydrolysis (using enzymes) or acid hydrolysis (using acids). It is a vital step in many industrial processes, including brewing, baking, and the production of ethanol from plant materials.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The saccharification is a sugar.","correct":"✓ The product of saccharification is sugar.","note":"Saccharification is a process, not a substance.

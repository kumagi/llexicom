It depends on factors like sugar content, moisture level, and the presence of epiphytic lactic acid bacteria, which are essential for successful fermentation. High ensilability indicates that the material will ferment readily, producing a well-preserved silage with a low pH, inhibiting spoilage organisms.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The ensilability are high.","correct":"✓ The ensilability is high.","note":"'Ensilability' is an uncountable noun, so it takes a singular verb."},{"incorrect":"✗ The crop had good ensile.","correct":"✓ The crop had good ensilability.","note":"'Ensilability' is the noun form.

It means 'without a tang'. A 'tang' can refer to a strong, sharp taste or flavor, or it can refer to a projecting piece of metal on a tool or weapon that attaches to the handle. Therefore, 'tangless' can describe food that lacks a strong flavor or a tool that lacks the part that connects to the handle.

It describes how effectively a circuit opposes changes in current flow within itself. A higher self-inductance means the circuit is more resistant to current changes. This property is crucial in designing circuits for various applications, including power supplies, filters, and oscillators.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The self inductance is measured in farads.","correct":"✓ The self-inductance is measured in henries.","note":"Self-inductance is measured in henries (H), not farads (F), which is the unit for capacitance."},{"incorrect":"✗ Self-inductance only occurs in circuits with multiple components.","correct":"✓ Self-inductance can occur in a single loop of wire, but is more significant in coils.","note":"While more pronounced in coils, self-inductance is a property of any circuit where a changing current creates a changing magnetic field."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["inductor","inductance","mutual inductance","induction"],"phrasal_verbs":[],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C1","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency","priority":"★★☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Self-inductance' is a technical term used in electrical engineering. It refers to the phenomenon where a changing electric current in a circuit creates a changing magnetic field, which in turn induces a voltage in the same circuit that opposes the change in current. This property is especially important in circuits containing coils or inductors. Understanding self-inductance requires knowledge of electromagnetism and circuit theory.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The high **self-inductance** of the transformer core helps to efficiently transfer energy between the primary and secondary windings.","translation":"トランスのコアの高い自己インダクタンスは、一次巻線と二次巻線の間で効率的にエネルギーを伝達するのに役立ちます。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"electrical property"},{"sentence":"The engineer carefully calculated the **self-inductance** of the coil to ensure the circuit would operate at the desired frequency.","translation":"エンジニアは、回路が目的の周波数で動作するように、コイルの自己インダクタンスを慎重に計算しました。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"calculation"},{"sentence":"The **self-inductance** of the wire can affect the signal integrity in high-speed circuits.","translation":"ワイヤの自己インダクタンスは、高速回路の信号品質に影響を与える可能性があります。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"signal integrity"}]}

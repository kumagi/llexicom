It's a term used in computer science, specifically in the context of operating systems and memory management. It refers to a page replacement algorithm that's a simplified version of the LRU (Least Recently Used) algorithm. It's less accurate than LRU but easier to implement, providing a trade-off between performance and complexity. Understanding ALRU requires knowledge of memory management concepts.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The operating system uses the ALRU algorithm to decide which page to evict from memory.","translation":"オペレーティングシステムは、どのページをメモリから追い出すかを決定するためにALRUアルゴリズムを使用します。","type":"definition","meaning_category":"computing"},{"sentence":"Implementing ALRU is often preferred over LRU due to its lower overhead.","translation":"ALRUの実装は、オーバーヘッドが少ないため、LRUよりも優先されることがよくあります。","type":"usage","meaning_category":"computing"}]}

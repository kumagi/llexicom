Common quantiles include quartiles (dividing the distribution into four equal parts), deciles (ten equal parts), and percentiles (one hundred equal parts). The median is the 0.5 quantile or the 50th percentile. Quantiles are useful for summarizing and comparing distributions and are less sensitive to outliers than measures like the mean.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The quantile is the average.","correct":"✓ The quantile is a value that divides the data into equal parts.","note":"A quantile is a point that divides a distribution; it is not a measure of central tendency like the average (mean)."},{"incorrect":"✗ Quantiles are only used for normal distributions.","correct":"✓ Quantiles can be used for any distribution.","note":"Quantiles are non-parametric and can be applied to any distribution, not just normal distributions."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":[],"phrasal_verbs":[],"related_terms":["quartile","percentile","decile","median","interquartile range","probability distribution","cumulative distribution function"],"priority":"★★★"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C1","frequency_google_ngram":"低頻度 (Low frequency) - 統計学やデータ分析の分野で使われる専門用語。","priority":"★★☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"A **quantile** is a point in a dataset that splits it into groups of equal size. Imagine you line up all your data points from smallest to largest. The quantile is the value at which a certain percentage of the data is below that value. For example, the median is a quantile that splits the data in half (50%). Quartiles split the data into four equal parts (25%, 50%, 75%), and percentiles split the data into 100 equal parts. Quantiles are useful for understanding how data is distributed and identifying specific values within that distribution. They are often used in statistics and data analysis to summarize and compare datasets.","priority":"★★★"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The third **quantile** represents the value below which 75% of the data falls.","translation":"第3分位数は、データの75％が下回る値を表します。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"分位数"},{"sentence":"We used **quantiles** to identify outliers in the dataset.","translation":"データセット内の外れ値を特定するために分位数を使用しました。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"分位数"},{"sentence":"**Quantile** regression is robust to outliers compared to ordinary least squares regression.","translation":"分位数回帰は、通常の最小二乗回帰と比較して、外れ値に対してロバストです。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"分位数"}]}

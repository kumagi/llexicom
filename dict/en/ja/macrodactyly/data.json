It is characterized by the excessive growth of one or more fingers or toes. The condition can be either static (where the growth is proportional to the rest of the body) or progressive (where the affected digits grow at a faster rate than the rest of the body). The cause of macrodactyly is not fully understood, but it is thought to be related to nerve or blood vessel abnormalities. Treatment typically involves surgery to reduce the size of the affected digits and improve hand or foot function.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ macrodactyl","correct":"✓ macrodactyly","note":"The correct term for the condition is 'macrodactyly,' not 'macrodactyl.'"},{"incorrect":"✗ macrodactilia","correct":"✓ macrodactyly","note":"While 'macrodactilia' might seem like a logical pluralization, the standard term is 'macrodactylies.'"}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["macrodactylous (adjective: having large fingers or toes)"],"phrasal_verbs":[],"priority":"★☆☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Very Low","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Macrodactyly' is a specialized medical term referring to a rare congenital condition characterized by abnormally large fingers or toes.

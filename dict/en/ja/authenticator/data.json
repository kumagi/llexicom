It's commonly used in the context of computer security, referring to apps or devices that provide extra security when logging into accounts. For example, instead of just using a password, you might use an authenticator app on your phone to generate a unique code that you also need to enter. This makes it harder for someone to hack into your account, because they would need both your password and access to your authenticator device. The word is derived from the verb 'authenticate', meaning to prove something is real or true."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The security system requires a hardware **authenticator** for access.","translation":"そのセキュリティシステムは、アクセスにハードウェア認証器を必要とします。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"device"},{"sentence":"She used the **authenticator app** on her phone to log in to her bank account.","translation":"彼女は銀行口座にログインするために、携帯電話の認証アプリを使用した。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"application"},{"sentence":"The museum hired an expert as an **authenticator** to verify the painting's origins.","translation":"美術館は絵画の起源を検証するために、専門家を認証者として雇った。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"person"}]}

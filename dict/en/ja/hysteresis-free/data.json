It describes a system or component that does not exhibit hysteresis, meaning its output is solely determined by its current input, without any dependence on its previous states or history. This is often a desired characteristic in sensors, actuators, and other devices where accuracy and predictability are important.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The material is hysteresis free.","correct":"✓ The material is hysteresis-free.","note":"The correct form is with a hyphen: 'hysteresis-free'."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["hysteresis","hysteretic"],"related_terms":["linearity","accuracy","precision","sensor","actuator"]},"level_frequency":{"frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency - primarily used in technical contexts.","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Hysteresis-free' is a technical term used in fields like engineering and physics. It describes something that doesn't have 'hysteresis'. Hysteresis means that the output of a system depends not only on the current input but also on its past inputs. So, 'hysteresis-free' means the output only depends on what's happening right now, not what happened before. This is good for things like sensors because it makes them more accurate."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The design goal was to create a hysteresis-free magnetic sensor.","translation":"設計目標は、ヒステリシスのない磁気センサーを作ることでした。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"technical description"},{"sentence":"Implementing feedback control can help make a system more hysteresis-free.","translation":"フィードバック制御を実装することで、システムをよりヒステリシスフリーにすることができます。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"technical application"}]}

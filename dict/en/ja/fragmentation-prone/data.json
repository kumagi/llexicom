It is often used in computer science (e.g., describing memory or data storage), materials science, and engineering. The term implies a negative characteristic, as fragmentation usually leads to inefficiency or instability.","priority":"N/A"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The fragmentation-prone of the hard drive caused errors.","correct":"✓ The fragmentation-proneness of the hard drive caused errors.","note":"'Fragmentation-prone' is an adjective, so it should be used to describe a noun.

It describes something that has a high likelihood of breaking into smaller pieces or becoming disorganized. Understanding this term requires familiarity with the concept of fragmentation in the relevant field. For example, in computer science, it might refer to a hard drive that tends to have its data scattered in non-contiguous blocks, leading to slower performance. In materials science, it might describe a material that easily breaks into shards upon impact."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The cheap plastic used in the toy was highly **fragmentation-prone**, posing a safety risk to children.","translation":"そのおもちゃに使われている安価なプラスチックは非常に**断片化しやすく**、子供たちに安全上のリスクをもたらした。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"Tendency to break into fragments"},{"sentence":"This type of memory allocation is known to be **fragmentation-prone**, requiring periodic defragmentation.","translation":"このタイプのメモリー割り当ては**断片化しやすい**ことが知られており、定期的なデフラグメンテーションが必要となる。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"Susceptible to fragmentation"},{"sentence":"The design of the explosive device made it highly **fragmentation-prone**, maximizing its destructive potential.","translation":"その爆発装置の設計は、破壊力を最大限に高めるために、非常に**断片化しやすく**なっていた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"Designed to fragment easily"}]}

Understanding requires familiarity with the concept of handicapping, which is a method of leveling the playing field between participants of different skill levels. The prefix 're-' indicates a repetition or adjustment of the handicapping process. Therefore, 'rehandicap' means to assess and adjust a handicap again, based on new information or performance. This term is not commonly used in general conversation and is more likely to be encountered in sports-related articles, rulebooks, or discussions.

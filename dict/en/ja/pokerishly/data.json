The term 'poker' refers to the card game, but in this context, it alludes to the expressionless face that skilled poker players maintain to conceal their emotions. The adverbial form '-ly' is then added to 'pokerish' to create 'pokerishly.'","priority":"★★★"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/ˈpoʊkərɪʃli/","syllables":"po-ker-ish-ly"},"inflection":{"notes":"This is an adverb, so it does not have different forms."},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Pokerishly' describes the manner in which something is done, emphasizing the lack of emotion or expression displayed.

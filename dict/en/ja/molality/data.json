It is defined as the number of moles of solute per kilogram of solvent. Unlike molarity, which is based on volume, molality is based on mass, making it independent of temperature changes. This is because mass does not change with temperature, whereas volume does. Molality is often used in situations where temperature variations are significant, such as in colligative properties calculations.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The molality of the solution changed with temperature.","correct":"✓ The molarity of the solution changed with temperature.","note":"Molality is independent of temperature, while molarity (moles per liter) changes with temperature due to volume expansion or contraction."},{"incorrect":"✗ Molality is the same as molarity.","correct":"✓ Molality is different from molarity.","note":"Molality is moles of solute per kilogram of solvent, while molarity is moles of solute per liter of solution."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["molal (adjective: relating to molality)"],"related_terms":["molarity","mole fraction","concentration","solution","solute","solvent"],"priority":"★★★"},"level_frequency":{"frequency_google_ngram":"Relatively low frequency, mainly used in chemistry and related fields.","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Molality' is a term used in chemistry to describe how much of a substance (the solute) is dissolved in a certain amount of another substance (the solvent). Specifically, it's the number of 'moles' of the solute for every kilogram of the solvent. It's different from 'molarity', which uses liters of solution instead of kilograms of solvent. Molality is useful because it doesn't change with temperature, making it reliable for precise scientific measurements.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"To prepare a 1 molal solution of NaCl, dissolve 58.44 grams of NaCl in 1 kilogram of water.","translation":"1モル濃度のNaCl溶液を調製するには、58.44グラムのNaClを1キログラムの水に溶解します。","type":"example","meaning_category":"definition"},{"sentence":"The experiment required precise control of molality to ensure accurate results.","translation":"実験では、正確な結果を保証するために、質量モル濃度の精密な制御が必要でした。","type":"example","meaning_category":"application"},{"sentence":"Molality is preferred over molarity when studying colligative properties.","translation":"束一的性質を研究する際には、モル濃度よりも質量モル濃度が好まれます。","type":"example","meaning_category":"usage"}]}

Barbiturates are a class of drugs that act as central nervous system depressants, meaning they slow down brain activity. Seconal was historically prescribed for its sedative and hypnotic (sleep-inducing) effects, primarily to treat insomnia or as a pre-anesthetic. However, due to the risk of dependence, overdose, and the availability of safer alternatives like benzodiazepines, Seconal is now rarely prescribed. It's important to note that barbiturates can be dangerous if misused or combined with other substances, such as alcohol."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The patient was given Seconal before the surgery to help her relax.","translation":"患者はリラックスするために手術前にセコナールを投与された。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"鎮静催眠薬"},{"sentence":"Seconal is a controlled substance due to its potential for abuse.","translation":"セコナールは乱用の可能性があるため、規制薬物である。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"鎮静催眠薬"}]}

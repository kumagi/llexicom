It doesn't necessarily mean that the object is actually perfectly streamlined in a technical or aerodynamic sense, but rather that it gives that impression.

Streamlining is a design principle that reduces resistance, often associated with speed and efficiency. Therefore, 'streamlined-appearing' indicates that something looks efficient, modern, and smooth, even if its actual aerodynamic properties are not fully tested or optimized. It's a more nuanced way of describing something that has a streamlined aesthetic.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The new train had a streamlined-appearing front, making it look very fast.","translation":"新しい列車は流線形に見える前面を持ち、非常に速そうに見えた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"流線形に見える"},{"sentence":"The website's streamlined-appearing design improved the user experience.","translation":"そのウェブサイトの合理化されたように見えるデザインは、ユーザーエクスペリエンスを向上させた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"合理化されたように見える"},{"sentence":"The streamlined-appearing architecture of the building gave it a futuristic feel.","translation":"その建物の流線形に見える建築様式は、未来的な雰囲気を与えた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"流線形に見える"},{"sentence":"The streamlined-appearing process reduced the number of steps required to complete the task.","translation":"その合理化されたように見えるプロセスは、タスクを完了するために必要なステップ数を減らした。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"合理化されたように見える"}]}

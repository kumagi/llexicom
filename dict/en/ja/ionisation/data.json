It refers to the process where an atom or molecule gains or loses electrons, resulting in the formation of ions (charged particles). This process often requires energy, such as radiation or heat. The term is commonly encountered in discussions about plasma, chemical reactions, and the behavior of matter at the atomic level. Understanding this term requires some background knowledge in science.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The high temperature caused the ionisation of the gas.","translation":"高温により、ガスがイオン化した。","type":"general","meaning_category":"process of becoming ionized"},{"sentence":"The degree of ionisation affects the conductivity of the solution.","translation":"イオン化の度合いは、溶液の伝導率に影響を与える。","type":"scientific","meaning_category":"effect on conductivity"},{"sentence":"Surface ionisation is used in some types of mass spectrometry.","translation":"表面イオン化は、一部の種類の質量分析法で使用される。","type":"technical","meaning_category":"application in mass spectrometry"}]}

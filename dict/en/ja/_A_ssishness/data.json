It is derived from 'ass,' a derogatory term for a donkey, implying stupidity. The suffix '-ness' turns the adjective 'assish' into a noun indicating a state or quality. Understanding the etymology helps in grasping the meaning, but it's generally better to use more common synonyms like 'foolishness' or 'stupidity' in most contexts."}}

This is related to Middle Dutch 'damp' and Old High German 'damph', both referring to vapor or steam. The sense of 'restraining' or 'depressing' something likely arose from the association of dampness with a lack of vitality or energy.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/dæmpt/","syllables":"damped"},"inflection":{"verb_forms":{"present_simple":["damp","damps"],"past_simple":"damped","past_participle":"damped","present_participle":"damping"}},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Damped' can function as both an adjective and a verb.

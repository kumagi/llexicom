It means that a particular piece of software or code is designed to work only on a specific operating system, such as Windows, macOS, or Linux. This is because it relies on features or functions that are unique to that operating system. If software is OS-dependent, it cannot be easily moved to another operating system without significant modifications. The opposite of OS-dependent is OS-independent or cross-platform, which means the software can run on multiple operating systems."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The game engine's rendering pipeline is highly OS-dependent.","translation":"そのゲームエンジンのレンダリングパイプラインは、OSへの依存度が高い。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"Technical Specification"},{"sentence":"Using OS-dependent libraries can improve performance but reduces portability.","translation":"OSに依存するライブラリを使用すると、パフォーマンスは向上しますが、移植性は低下します。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"Trade-offs in Software Development"},{"sentence":"The developer chose to use OS-dependent APIs for accessing hardware.","translation":"開発者は、ハードウェアにアクセスするためにOSに依存するAPIを使用することを選択しました。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"API Usage"}]}

They are typically formed through the reaction of ozone with unsaturated organic compounds, such as alkenes. Due to their instability, ozonides are often used as intermediates in chemical synthesis rather than as final products. Their decomposition can be explosive, making them potentially hazardous.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The ozonide is very stable.","correct":"✓ The ozonide is generally unstable.","note":"Ozonides are known for their instability, so stating they are 'very stable' is generally incorrect unless specific stabilizing modifications have been made."}],"priority":"★☆☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["ozonation (名詞: オゾン処理)","ozone (名詞: オゾン)"],"phrasal_verbs":[]},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"The term 'ozonide' is a technical term used in organic chemistry.

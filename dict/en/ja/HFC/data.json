It's a type of man-made gas used in things like refrigerators and air conditioners. Even though HFCs don't hurt the ozone layer, they're bad for the environment because they trap a lot of heat in the atmosphere, which contributes to global warming. Because of this, many countries are trying to use them less and find better alternatives. Understanding HFCs is important for discussing climate change and environmental policies."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The new air conditioner uses a refrigerant with a lower global warming potential than traditional HFCs.","translation":"新しいエアコンは、従来のHFCよりも地球温暖化係数の低い冷媒を使用しています。","type":"general","meaning_category":"Definition"},{"sentence":"Scientists are developing new chemicals to replace HFCs in industrial applications.","translation":"科学者たちは、産業用途でHFCを代替する新しい化学物質を開発しています。","type":"general","meaning_category":"Usage"}]}

The exact origin of 'phony' is uncertain, but it may be related to the word 'fawney,' a term for a gilded ring used by swindlers. Another theory suggests it comes from the telephone, which was new at the time and perceived by some as a device for deception. The '-est' suffix indicates the superlative degree.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/ˈfoʊniəst/","syllables":"pho-ni-est"},"inflection":{"adjective_forms":{"comparative":"phonier","superlative":"phoneiest"}},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Phoneiest' is used to describe something that is the most fake, insincere, or not genuine compared to other things of the same kind.

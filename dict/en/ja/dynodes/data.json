PMTs are vacuum tubes that are extremely sensitive to light, and they are used to detect very weak light signals. When a photon strikes the photocathode of a PMT, it releases an electron (photoelectron). This photoelectron is then accelerated towards the first dynode. When the photoelectron strikes the dynode, it releases several more electrons (secondary electrons). These secondary electrons are then accelerated towards the next dynode, where the process is repeated. This multiplication process continues through a series of dynodes, resulting in a large amplification of the original signal.","priority":"☆☆☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The dynode amplify the light directly.","correct":"✓ The dynodes amplify the electron signal.","note":"Dynodes amplify the electron signal, not the light directly.

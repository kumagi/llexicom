It's often used collectively – you wouldn’t say ‘a fowl’, but ‘farm fowl’ or ‘poultry’.  It can also refer to wild birds hunted for sport, though 'game bird' is more common in that case. The word sometimes carries a slightly old-fashioned feel and isn’t as frequently used in everyday conversation compared to terms like 'chicken' or 'bird'."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The farmer raised various kinds of **fowl**, including chickens, ducks, and geese.","translation":"農家は鶏、鴨、ガチョウなど様々な家禽を飼っていた。","type":"noun (domestic birds)","meaning_category":"家禽"},{"sentence":"The hunter bagged several **fowl** during the hunting season.","translation":"そのハンターは狩猟シーズン中にいくつかの鳥を捕獲した。","type":"noun (game birds)","meaning_category":"狩猟の獲物"},{"sentence":"She prepared a delicious roast **fowl** for dinner.","translation":"彼女は夕食に美味しい焼き鳥を作った。","type":"noun (food)","meaning_category":"食用としての鳥"},{"sentence":"The poultry yard was filled with clucking **fowl**.","translation":"鶏小屋はコケコッコーと鳴く家禽でいっぱいだった。","type":"noun (collective)","meaning_category":"集団としての鳥"}]}

It describes a person or thing that is considered odd, strange, or eccentric. Due to its slang nature, it is not commonly used or understood outside of Australia, and even within Australia, its usage may vary depending on region and social group. Therefore, it is not a word that learners of English would typically need to know unless they have a specific interest in Australian slang or are interacting frequently with Australian English speakers."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"He's a bit of an onker, always wearing mismatched socks.","translation":"彼は少し変わった人で、いつも左右違う靴下を履いている。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"strange person"},{"sentence":"That's a pretty onker idea, but it might just work.","translation":"それはかなり奇抜なアイデアだけど、うまくいくかもしれない。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"strange"}]}

It's often used in scientific or technical contexts, such as when discussing the development of new medicines or food products. The word is formed by adding the prefix \"non-\" to \"palatability,\" which means the quality of being pleasing to the taste. Therefore, \"nonpalatability\" simply means the opposite – not pleasing to the taste. Because it's a more technical term, it's not commonly used in everyday conversation.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The researchers aimed to reduce the nonpalatability of the new drug formulation.","translation":"研究者たちは、新しい薬の製剤の美味しくなさを軽減することを目指した。","type":"general","meaning_category":"general"},{"sentence":"The nonpalatability of certain wild plants protects them from being eaten by herbivores.","translation":"特定の野生植物の美味しくなさは、草食動物に食べられるのを防いでいる。","type":"general","meaning_category":"general"},{"sentence":"The food scientist worked to mask the nonpalatability of the fortified ingredients.","translation":"食品科学者は、強化された成分の美味しくなさを隠すために働いた。","type":"general","meaning_category":"general"}]}

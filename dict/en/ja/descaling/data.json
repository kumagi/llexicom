This is commonly done on appliances like kettles, coffee machines, and boilers to maintain their efficiency and prevent damage. The term can be used as both a noun (the process itself) and a verb (the act of removing scale).","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ I'm going to descale the fish.","correct":"✓ I'm going to scale the fish.","note":"'Descale' refers to removing mineral scale, not fish scales.

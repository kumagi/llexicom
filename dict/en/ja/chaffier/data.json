'Chaffy' can mean either 'resembling chaff' (i.e., light, worthless material) or 'given to light or good-humored banter'.

'Chaffy' itself is not a common word, so 'chaffier' is even less frequent. It can describe something that is more like chaff (the husks of grains), implying worthlessness, or someone who is more given to light banter or joking. Its usage is quite specialized, making it rare in general conversation or writing."},"example_sentences":[]}

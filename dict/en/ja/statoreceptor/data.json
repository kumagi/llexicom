They are found in various organisms, including vertebrates and invertebrates. In vertebrates, statoreceptors are primarily located in the inner ear, specifically in the vestibular system. These receptors play a crucial role in maintaining balance and spatial orientation.","priority":"N/A"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[],"priority":"N/A"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["statocyst","vestibular system","otolith"],"phrasal_verbs":[],"priority":"N/A"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"N/A","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency","priority":"N/A"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C2","text":"The term \"statoreceptor\" refers to a specialized sensory receptor responsible for detecting changes in an organism's orientation and balance. It is a technical term primarily used in biology and related fields. Understanding this term requires a background in biology or physiology, particularly knowledge of sensory systems and balance mechanisms. The word's etymology reflects its function, as it combines \"stato-\" (referring to state or position) with \"receptor\" (something that receives stimuli)."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The marine invertebrate uses its statoreceptor to orient itself in the water column.","translation":"その海洋無脊椎動物は、水中で自身の方向を定めるために平衡受容器を使用する。","type":"scientific","meaning_category":"orientation"},{"sentence":"Damage to the vestibular statoreceptor can result in balance disorders.","translation":"前庭平衡受容器の損傷は、平衡障害を引き起こす可能性がある。","type":"medical","meaning_category":"balance"}]}

'Defy' comes from the Old French 'desfier,' meaning 'to renounce faith in, to challenge,' which in turn comes from Vulgar Latin '*disfidare,' meaning 'to break faith.' This is composed of 'dis-' (expressing reversal or negation) and 'fidare' (to trust), from 'fides' (faith).","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/dɪˈfaɪərz/","syllables":"de-fi-ers"},"inflection":{"noun_plural":"defiers"},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Defiers' refers to multiple individuals who actively resist or challenge established norms, rules, or authorities.

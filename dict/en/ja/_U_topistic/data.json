'Utopia' combines the Greek 'ou' (not) and 'topos' (place) to mean 'no place,' or 'nowhere,' and 'eu' (good) and 'topos' (place) to mean 'good place.' Thus, 'utopia' refers to an ideal place that does not exist. 'Utopistic' is the adjective form, describing something characteristic of or related to utopia.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/ˌjuːtəˈpɪstɪk/","syllables":"u-to-pis-tic"},"inflection":{"notes":"This is an adjective and does not have plural forms."},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Utopistic' is used to describe ideas, plans, or visions that are extremely idealistic and unlikely to be realized in practice. It often carries a connotation of being naive or impractical. While utopian ideals can be inspiring, the term 'utopistic' suggests that these ideals are so far removed from reality that they are not feasible. It's important to distinguish 'utopistic' from simply 'idealistic'; 'utopistic' implies a greater degree of unreality.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The company's utopistic profits allowed them to expand rapidly.","correct":"✓ The company's impressive profits allowed them to expand rapidly.","note":"'Utopistic' refers to ideals or plans, not simply positive outcomes.

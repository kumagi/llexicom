It means that something does not have blood vessels (in animals) or vascular bundles (in plants). This term is most often used in scientific or medical contexts. For example, cartilage is a non-vascularized tissue. This means that it doesn't have blood vessels running through it. Instead, it gets nutrients through diffusion. Similarly, mosses are non-vascularized plants, meaning they lack the complex system of vessels that transport water and nutrients in more advanced plants."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The surgeon prepared the **non-vascularized** bone graft for implantation.","translation":"外科医は移植のために非血管性の骨移植片を準備した。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"医学"},{"sentence":"Bryophytes are **non-vascularized** plants that thrive in moist environments.","translation":"蘚苔植物は湿った環境で生育する維管束を持たない植物です。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"植物学"},{"sentence":"Diffusion is the primary method of nutrient transport in **non-vascularized** tissues.","translation":"拡散は非血管性の組織における主要な栄養輸送方法です。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"生物学"}]}

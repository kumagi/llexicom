This often involves techniques like reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) where the feedback emphasizes truthfulness, or training on datasets specifically curated for factual correctness.","examples":[{"sentence":"The new truth-instructed AI model showed a significant improvement in reducing hallucinated facts.","translation":"新しい真実性に基づき指示されたAIモデルは、幻覚のような事実を減少させる上で著しい改善を示した。"},{"sentence":"Researchers are exploring various methods to make large language models more truth-instructed.","translation":"研究者たちは、大規模言語モデルをより真実性に基づき指示されるようにするための様々な方法を模索している。"},{"sentence":"The goal is to create AI systems that are not only helpful and informative but also rigorously truth-instructed.","translation":"目標は、役立ち情報を提供するだけでなく、厳密に真実性に基づき指示されたAIシステムを構築することである。"}],"collocations":["truth-instructed AI","truth-instructed model","truth-instructed training","truth-instructed learning","truth-instructed system"],"synonyms":["factually aligned","truthful","verifiable","accurate","reliable"],"antonyms":["hallucinatory","misleading","false","inaccurate","unreliable"]}],"etymology":{"value":"A compound word formed by combining \"truth\" with \"instructed.\" The term \"instructed\" implies a deliberate process of training or guiding the AI to adhere to principles of truthfulness.","priority":"N/A"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/ˈtruːθ ɪnˌstrʌktɪd/","syllables":"truth-in-struct-ed"},"inflection":{"notes":"This is an adjective, so it does not inflect like a verb.

It emphasizes that the model has undergone specific training or instruction to prioritize truthfulness over other objectives, such as creativity or fluency. This is particularly relevant for large language models (LLMs) that are prone to generating plausible but incorrect information, often referred to as 'hallucinations.'","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The AI is truth-instructing.","correct":"✓ The AI is being truth-instructed.","note":"'Truth-instructed' is typically used as a past participle adjective, describing the state of the AI after training.

The prefix 'des-' indicates negation or reversal, hence 'defy' signifies a lack of trust or a challenge to authority.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/dɪˈfaɪəntli/","syllables":"de-fi-ant-ly"},"inflection":{"notes":"'Defiantly' is an adverb and does not have different inflections."},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Defiantly' describes actions or behaviors that openly show resistance or disobedience to authority, rules, or expectations.

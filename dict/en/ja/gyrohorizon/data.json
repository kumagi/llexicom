It uses a gyroscope to maintain a stable reference, allowing pilots to determine whether the aircraft is level, climbing, descending, or banking, especially in conditions where the natural horizon is not visible (e.g., in clouds or at night).","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The gyrohorizon showed the speed of the plane.","correct":"✓ The gyrohorizon showed the attitude of the plane.","note":"The gyrohorizon indicates the aircraft's attitude (orientation), not its speed."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["gyroscope","horizon"],"phrasal_verbs":[]},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low","priority":"★★☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"The term 'gyrohorizon' refers to a specialized instrument used in aviation.

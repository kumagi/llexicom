It implies a subtle and often indirect form of criticism or belittlement. Because of its infrequent usage, it is more likely to be encountered in advanced texts or conversations. It is important to distinguish it from the adjective \"snide,\" which is more commonly used. Understanding the context is key to grasping the meaning of \"snidery,\" as it often involves social dynamics and subtle forms of communication.","priority":"★☆☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The office was rife with snidery after the promotion announcement.","translation":"昇進の発表後、オフィスは陰口であふれていた。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"陰口、当てこすり"},{"sentence":"I couldn't stand the constant snidery in their conversations.","translation":"彼らの会話の絶え間ない当てこすりには我慢できなかった。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"陰口、当てこすり"},{"sentence":"She was tired of the snidery directed at her work.","translation":"彼女は自分の仕事に向けられる当てこすりにうんざりしていた。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"陰口、当てこすり"}]}

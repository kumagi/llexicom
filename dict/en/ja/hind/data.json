As an adjective, \"hind\" describes something located at the back or rear, often used in anatomical or technical contexts (e.g., \"hind legs\"). As a noun, \"hind\" refers specifically to a female red deer, typically one that is at least three years old. Due to their infrequent use, these terms are more likely to be encountered in specialized texts or older literature.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The lion stalked its prey from behind, focusing on the **hind** quarters.","translation":"ライオンは獲物の後ろから忍び寄り、後部に焦点を当てた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"後部の"},{"sentence":"The **hind** blended seamlessly into the forest, making it difficult to spot.","translation":"雌鹿は森に溶け込み、見つけるのが困難だった。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"雌鹿"}]}

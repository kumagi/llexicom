The aerodynamic effects are different from lower subsonic speeds, and approaching the speed of sound introduces compressibility effects.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The plane flew at supersonic, but almost high-subsonic.","correct":"✓ The plane flew at supersonic speeds, but almost at high-subsonic speeds.","note":"'Supersonic' and 'high-subsonic' are adjectives that should modify a noun like 'speed' or 'velocity'."}],"priority":"N/A"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["subsonic","supersonic","transonic","hypersonic"],"phrases":["speed of sound","Mach number","aerodynamics","compressibility"],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2 (Technical vocabulary)","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency.

It describes speeds that are fast but still slower than the speed of sound. When an object moves at high-subsonic speeds, the air around it behaves in ways that are different from when it moves at slower speeds. This is important for designing aircraft and other objects that need to move through the air efficiently at these speeds. Understanding this term requires some background knowledge in physics and engineering."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The new fighter jet can achieve high-subsonic speeds with ease.","translation":"その新型戦闘機は、容易に高速亜音速に達することができる。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"Describing speed"},{"sentence":"Wind tunnel tests were conducted to analyze the high-subsonic airflow around the wing.","translation":"翼周りの高速亜音速気流を解析するために、風洞試験が実施された。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"Describing airflow"}]}

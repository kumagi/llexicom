It can refer to physical size, like a child's clothes, or to interests and abilities. For example, a company might 'outgrow' its office space, meaning it needs a larger office because it has expanded. Or someone might 'outgrow' a hobby, meaning they are no longer interested in it because they have developed new interests or skills.

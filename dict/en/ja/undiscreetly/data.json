The word often suggests that the action was noticeable or obvious, making the lack of discretion even more apparent.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ He acted undiscreetly, but nobody noticed.","correct":"✓ He acted undiscreetly, so everyone noticed.","note":"Acting undiscreetly implies that the action is noticeable.

It's the opposite of being discreet, which means being careful about what you say or do to avoid causing offense or revealing secrets. Think of it as acting without thinking about the consequences or how others might react. It's a more advanced word, so you'll likely encounter it in more complex texts or discussions about social behavior and judgment."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The politician undiscreetly accepted the bribe, which was caught on camera.","translation":"その政治家は軽率に賄賂を受け取り、カメラに捉えられた。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"軽率に"},{"sentence":"She laughed undiscreetly at his joke, even though it was offensive.","translation":"彼女は彼のジョークが不快だったにもかかわらず、思慮なく笑った。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"思慮なく"},{"sentence":"He checked his phone undiscreetly during the meeting, drawing the attention of his colleagues.","translation":"彼は会議中に軽率に携帯電話をチェックし、同僚の注意を引いた。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"目立つように"},{"sentence":"The journalist undiscreetly published the confidential documents.","translation":"そのジャーナリストは無分別に機密文書を公開した。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"無分別に"}]}

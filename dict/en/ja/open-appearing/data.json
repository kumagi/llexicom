It often implies that the actual degree of openness may be less than it appears. It is often used in contexts where design, architecture, or personal presentation are being discussed. It is relatively uncommon compared to simpler terms like 'open' or 'accessible.'","priority":"N/A"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"The door was open-appearing, but it was actually locked.","correct":"The door was seemingly open, but it was actually locked.","note":"'Open-appearing' is better used to describe a general impression rather than a specific state.

It suggests that something gives the impression of being open or accessible, even if this impression might not be entirely accurate or genuine. This term is more likely to be encountered in formal writing or discussions about design, architecture, or interpersonal communication where the nuances of perceived openness are important. It requires a good understanding of both the literal and figurative meanings of 'open' and 'appearance.'"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The building's facade was designed to be open-appearing, inviting visitors inside.","translation":"その建物のファサードは、訪問者を中に誘うように、開放的に見えるように設計された。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"design/architecture"},{"sentence":"Despite her friendly smile, her eyes lacked an open-appearing quality.","translation":"彼女の友好的な笑顔にもかかわらず、彼女の目には開放的に見える性質が欠けていた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"personal presentation"},{"sentence":"The website's layout is open-appearing, making it easy for users to find what they need.","translation":"そのウェブサイトのレイアウトは開放的に見えるため、ユーザーは必要なものを簡単に見つけることができる。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"design/interface"}]}

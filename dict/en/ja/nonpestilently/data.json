It is formed by negating the adverb 'pestilently', which itself is derived from 'pestilent'. The word is primarily used in formal or technical contexts to describe actions or processes that are conducted in a manner that prevents the spread of disease, harm, or moral corruption. Due to its rarity and complexity, it is unlikely to be encountered in everyday language.

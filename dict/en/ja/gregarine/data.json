They are typically found in the gut of their hosts and are relatively large compared to other protozoan parasites. While some gregarines can cause disease in their hosts, many are considered to be relatively harmless. They are of interest to biologists studying parasitism and evolution.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Gregarine is a type of bacteria.","correct":"✓ Gregarine is a type of protozoan.","note":"Gregarines are protozoans, not bacteria."},{"incorrect":"✗ Gregarines are beneficial to their hosts.","correct":"✓ Gregarines are parasitic to their hosts.","note":"Gregarines are parasites, meaning they are harmful, not beneficial, to their hosts."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["gregarinasina (class of protozoans)","gregarious (tending to form a group)"],"phrasal_verbs":[]},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Very low frequency","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Gregarine' is a specialized term in biology, specifically referring to a type of parasitic protozoan.

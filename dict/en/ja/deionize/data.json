It describes the process of removing ions from a solution, typically water, to achieve a high level of purity. The word is formed by adding the prefix 'de-' (meaning 'removal' or 'reversal') to 'ionize' (to convert into ions). Understanding this term is crucial in contexts where the presence of ions can interfere with experiments or processes.","priority":"★★★"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The lab technician carefully deionized the water before preparing the samples.","translation":"実験室の技術者は、サンプルを準備する前に注意深く水を脱イオン化した。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"脱イオン化する"},{"sentence":"The deionized water is used to clean sensitive electronic components.","translation":"脱イオン水は、敏感な電子部品を洗浄するために使用される。","type":"adjective (participle)","meaning_category":"脱イオン化された"}]}

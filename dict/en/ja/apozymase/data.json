It refers to the protein part of an enzyme that needs a helper molecule (cofactor) to work. Think of it as the inactive enzyme waiting for its key (cofactor) to unlock its function. It's not a word you'll encounter in everyday conversation, but it's important in the study of enzymes.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The binding of the coenzyme to the apozymase induces a conformational change.","translation":"補酵素のアポ酵素への結合は、立体構造の変化を引き起こします。","type":"scientific","meaning_category":"biochemistry"},{"sentence":"Without the necessary cofactor, the apozymase remains inactive.","translation":"必要な補因子がないと、アポ酵素は不活性のままです。","type":"scientific","meaning_category":"biochemistry"}]}

It refers to the inherent possibility that a theory or hypothesis can be proven wrong through empirical testing or observation.

It's important to note that refutability doesn't mean that a statement *is* false, but rather that it *could be* proven false.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The refutability of the evidence was clear.","correct":"✓ The lack of refutability of the claim was clear.","note":"'Refutability' applies to claims, hypotheses, or theories, not directly to evidence.

It describes the characteristic of a statement, hypothesis, or theory that allows it to be proven false through observation or experimentation. A high degree of refutability means that there are many ways the statement could be shown to be wrong, which is considered a strength in scientific theories. If a statement is impossible to refute, it is considered unscientific because it cannot be tested. Understanding this term requires familiarity with the scientific method and philosophical concepts of knowledge and proof."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The scientist designed the experiment to maximize the **refutability** of his hypothesis.","translation":"科学者は、仮説の反駁可能性を最大化するために実験を設計した。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"反駁可能性"},{"sentence":"Critics questioned the **refutability** of the author's claims, arguing they were too vague to be tested.","translation":"批評家たちは、著者の主張があまりにも曖昧で検証できないとして、その反駁可能性に疑問を呈した。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"反駁可能性"},{"sentence":"The principle of **refutability** is a cornerstone of modern scientific thought.","translation":"反駁可能性の原則は、現代科学思想の基礎である。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"反駁可能性"}]}

'Homely' comes from 'home' + '-ly' (suffix meaning 'having qualities of').

One meaning refers to appearance, indicating the least attractive or plainest. The other meaning refers to a place or environment, indicating the most comfortable, cozy, and home-like atmosphere. Context is crucial to understanding which meaning is intended. The 'unattractive' sense is more common in contemporary usage, but the 'cozy' sense still exists.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ She is the homeliest person because she is always happy.","correct":"✓ She is the most homely person because she is always happy.","note":"If you want to convey that someone is comfortable and enjoys domestic life, use 'homely.' 'Homeliest' as 'unattractive' doesn't connect to happiness. The sentence can also be rephrased as 'She is the most home-loving person because she is always happy.'"},{"incorrect":"✗ The homeliest hotel was very modern and stylish.","correct":"✓ The most homely hotel was very traditional and cozy.","note":"'Homeliest' (meaning 'coziest') implies a traditional, comfortable, and inviting atmosphere, not a modern or stylish one.

Albumin is a protein made by the liver and is essential for maintaining fluid balance, transporting hormones, vitamins, and enzymes, and repairing tissues. Common causes include liver disease, kidney disease, malnutrition, inflammation, and certain infections. Symptoms may include edema (swelling), fatigue, and muscle loss. Diagnosis is typically made through a blood test. Treatment focuses on addressing the underlying cause and may include dietary changes, albumin infusions, and medications.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Hypoalbuminemia is when you have too much albumin.","correct":"✓ Hypoalbuminemia is when you have too little albumin.","note":"'Hypo-' means 'too little' or 'below normal,' not 'too much'."},{"incorrect":"✗ Hypoalbuminemia is treated with increasing protein intake only.","correct":"✓ Hypoalbuminemia is treated by addressing the underlying cause, which may include increasing protein intake.","note":"While increasing protein intake can be part of the treatment, it's crucial to address the underlying cause of the condition."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["albumin (noun)","albuminuria (noun)","hyperalbuminemia (noun)"],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency - Primarily used in medical contexts.","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Hypoalbuminemia' is a technical medical term referring to a condition where the blood has abnormally low levels of albumin, a vital protein.

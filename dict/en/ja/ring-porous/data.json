This is in contrast to 'diffuse-porous' wood, where the vessels are more evenly distributed throughout the growth ring.

It refers to wood where the larger pores (vessels) are concentrated in the earlywood, creating a visible ring pattern. This term is primarily used in fields like forestry, botany, and woodworking to classify and describe different types of wood based on their structure. Understanding this term requires some background knowledge of wood anatomy.","example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The distinct ring-porous structure of oak makes it easily identifiable.","translation":"オークの明確な環孔性構造により、容易に識別できます。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"describing wood structure"},{"sentence":"Ring-porous wood is often preferred for furniture making due to its strength and aesthetic appeal.","translation":"環孔材は、その強度と美的魅力から、家具製造によく使用されます。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"application of wood type"}]}}

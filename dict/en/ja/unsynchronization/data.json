It can be unintentional, such as when a network error causes data to become out of sync, or it can be a deliberate artistic choice, such as in music where rhythmic unsynchronization is used for effect.

It refers to the state where things that should be happening together or in a coordinated way are no longer doing so. This can occur in various contexts, such as computer systems, audio-visual recordings, or even in musical performances. Understanding the term requires a grasp of the concept of 'synchronization' and the effect of the 'un-' prefix, which negates the original meaning.

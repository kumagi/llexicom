Imagine a tiny bubble (vesicle) inside the cell containing molecules. This bubble moves to the cell's outer layer (membrane), merges with it, and releases its contents outside the cell. This is crucial for cell communication, waste removal, and secretion of hormones and proteins. It's a key process in cell biology.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The release of neurotransmitters at synapses occurs via exocytosis.","translation":"シナプスでの神経伝達物質の放出は、エキソサイトーシスを介して起こります。","type":"scientific context","meaning_category":"細胞外放出"},{"sentence":"Exocytosis is a critical process for the growth and repair of tissues.","translation":"エキソサイトーシスは、組織の成長と修復に不可欠なプロセスです。","type":"biological context","meaning_category":"細胞外放出"},{"sentence":"The cell uses exocytosis to secrete digestive enzymes.","translation":"細胞はエキソサイトーシスを使用して消化酵素を分泌します。","type":"cellular biology","meaning_category":"細胞外放出"}]}

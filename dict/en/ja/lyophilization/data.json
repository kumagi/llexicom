It's a method to preserve materials by removing water, which inhibits microbial growth and chemical reactions. The process involves freezing the material and then reducing the surrounding pressure to allow the frozen water to sublimate directly from the solid phase to the gas phase. The result is a stable, dry product that can be easily stored and reconstituted.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ lyophilisation","correct":"✓ lyophilization","note":"'Lyophilization' is the standard spelling in American English.

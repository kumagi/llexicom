However, opsonoids differ from traditional opsonins (like antibodies) in that they do not rely on antibody-antigen interactions to achieve this effect. They may act through other mechanisms to facilitate the recognition and uptake of foreign particles by phagocytic cells.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[],"priority":"☆☆☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["opsonin","opsonization","phagocytosis"],"phrasal_verbs":[]},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Very low frequency","priority":"☆☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C2","text":"The term 'opsonoid' is a specialized term in immunology, referring to substances that promote phagocytosis without being antibodies.

It suggests a smile that is not fully expressed or easily noticed, often implying a subtle or internal amusement. The word is formed by combining 'sub-' (meaning 'under' or 'less than') and 'smile', indicating a smile that is less than a full or obvious one. Due to its infrequent usage, it is more likely to be encountered in literary or descriptive contexts where precise language is valued."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"A subsmile touched her lips as she recalled the funny incident.","translation":"彼女がその面白い出来事を思い出すと、かすかな笑みが彼女の唇に浮かんだ。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"faint smile"},{"sentence":"He subsmiled, hiding his amusement behind a mask of seriousness.","translation":"彼は真面目な顔の裏に隠して、かすかに微笑んだ。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"smile faintly"}]}

In mathematics, it describes the relationship between vectors, lines, or functions that meet at a 90-degree angle.

In software engineering, orthogonality is a design principle that aims to minimize dependencies between different modules, making the system easier to understand, maintain, and modify.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The orthogonality is when two lines are parallel.","correct":"✓ The orthogonality is when two lines are perpendicular.","note":"Orthogonality implies perpendicularity, not parallelism."},{"incorrect":"✗ Orthogonality means the systems are dependent on each other.","correct":"✓ Orthogonality means the systems are independent of each other.","note":"Orthogonality suggests independence, not dependence."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["orthogonal (adjective)","orthogonally (adverb)"],"related_terms":["perpendicular","normal","vector space","linear algebra","signal processing","software engineering"],"priority":"★★★"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency - Primarily used in technical and academic contexts.","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Orthogonality' is a technical term primarily used in mathematics, physics, engineering, and computer science.

This process is particularly important in the context of drug metabolism, where the body modifies drugs to facilitate their elimination. It can also apply to the modification of other compounds, such as pollutants. Biotransformation can result in detoxification (making a substance less toxic) or bioactivation (making a substance more active or even toxic).","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The biotransformation only detoxifies substances.","correct":"✓ The biotransformation can detoxify or bioactivate substances.","note":"Biotransformation can lead to both detoxification and bioactivation, not just detoxification."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["biotransform (verb)"],"phrasal_verbs":[]},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C1","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Biotransformation' is a technical term primarily used in biology, biochemistry, and pharmacology. It describes the process where a living organism alters the chemical structure of a substance, like a drug or pollutant. This process can either make the substance less harmful (detoxification) or more harmful (bioactivation). Understanding this term requires a solid foundation in scientific concepts."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The liver is the primary site of drug **biotransformation**.","translation":"肝臓は薬物の生体内変換の主要な場所である。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"生体内変換"},{"sentence":"Researchers are studying the **biotransformation** pathways of various pesticides in soil.","translation":"研究者たちは、土壌中の様々な農薬の生体内変換経路を研究している。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"生体内変換"}]}

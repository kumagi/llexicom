It describes materials or objects that maintain their shape and dimensions even when subjected to external forces. The term is often used in theoretical models and simulations where ideal, nondeformable objects simplify calculations. In real-world applications, no material is perfectly nondeformable, but some materials exhibit very low deformation under typical conditions and can be approximated as such.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The nondeformable plastic broke under pressure.","correct":"✓ The rigid plastic broke under pressure.","note":"If a material breaks, it implies that it has deformed to some extent before fracturing.

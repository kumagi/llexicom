'Mercury' comes from Latin 'Mercurius', the Roman god of commerce, eloquence, and messages, also associated with the element mercury. '-ize' is a suffix used to form verbs meaning 'to treat with' or 'to convert into'.

Historically, it was used in various industrial processes, such as felt hat manufacturing and early photography. Due to the toxicity of mercury, the process is now less common and heavily regulated. The term can be used as a verb (e.g., 'They are mercurizing the silver') or as a noun referring to the process itself (e.g., 'Mercurizing is a dangerous practice').","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ They are mercurizing with gold.","correct":"✓ They are mercurizing with mercury.","note":"Mercurizing specifically involves the use of mercury.

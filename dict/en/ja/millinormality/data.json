It is defined as one-thousandth of a normality (N) solution. Normality, in turn, is a measure of the number of gram equivalent weights of a solute per liter of solution. Millinormality is often used when dealing with very dilute solutions.","priority":"☆☆☆"},"common_mistakes":{},"related_words":{"derivatives":["normality","milli-","normal"],"phrasal_verbs":[]},"level_frequency":{},"readability_explanation":{"level":"","text":""},"example_sentences":[]}

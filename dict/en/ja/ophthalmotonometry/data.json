This procedure is crucial in ophthalmology for the detection and management of glaucoma.

Understanding this term is typically limited to those in the medical field, particularly ophthalmologists and optometrists.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The doctor used applanation ophthalmotonometry to measure the patient's intraocular pressure.","translation":"医師はアプラネーション眼圧測定法を用いて患者の眼圧を測定した。","type":"general","meaning_category":"眼圧測定"},{"sentence":"Elevated intraocular pressure detected by ophthalmotonometry can be an indicator of glaucoma.","translation":"眼圧測定で検出された眼圧の上昇は、緑内障の指標となる可能性がある。","type":"medical","meaning_category":"眼圧測定"},{"sentence":"Regular ophthalmotonometry is recommended for individuals over the age of 40 to screen for glaucoma.","translation":"40歳以上の人は緑内障のスクリーニングのために定期的な眼圧測定が推奨されます。","type":"recommendation","meaning_category":"眼圧測定"}]}

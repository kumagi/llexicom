It forms in wetlands or peatlands, also known as bogs, mires, moors, or muskegs. Peat is distinguished from other organic soil constituents by its identifiable plant structure. Peat accumulates in wet, acidic conditions where decomposition is slowed. It is used as a fuel in some regions, particularly where other fuel sources are scarce. It is also used in horticulture and gardening to improve soil structure and water retention. However, peat extraction can have negative environmental impacts, including habitat destruction and carbon emissions.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ I bought some beat moss for my garden.","correct":"✓ I bought some peat moss for my garden.","note":"'Peat moss' (泥炭藓) is a common gardening material.

As a noun, it refers to the state of being disconnected."},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Grid-disconnected' is often used in the context of renewable energy systems, such as solar or wind power, that operate independently of the main power grid. These systems typically require battery storage to provide power when the renewable energy source is not available. The term can also refer to a lifestyle where a person or community chooses to live without being connected to the public power supply.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The house is grid disconnected.","correct":"✓ The house is grid-disconnected.","note":"Hyphenation is important for clarity.

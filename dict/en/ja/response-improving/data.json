{"request":"response-improving","description":"This category encompasses techniques and strategies aimed at enhancing the quality, relevance, and effectiveness of responses generated by language models or other AI systems. It includes methods for improving accuracy, coherence, fluency, and user satisfaction.","subcategories":[{"name":"Prompt Engineering","description":"Designing effective prompts to elicit desired responses from language models. This involves crafting clear, specific, and context-rich prompts that guide the model towards generating relevant and accurate outputs.","techniques":["Few-shot learning","Chain-of-thought prompting","Role prompting","Prompt templates","Adversarial prompting (to test robustness)"]},{"name":"Fine-tuning","description":"Adapting a pre-trained language model to a specific task or domain by training it on a dataset of relevant examples. This allows the model to learn task-specific patterns and generate more accurate and tailored responses.","methods":["Supervised fine-tuning","Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)","Domain adaptation","Continual learning"]},{"name":"Response Evaluation","description":"Developing metrics and methods for evaluating the quality of generated responses.

For example, some languages change the endings of verbs to show when something happened (past, present, future) or change the endings of nouns to show their role in a sentence (subject, object). A language with high 'inflectedness' uses these changes a lot, while a language with low 'inflectedness' doesn't."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"Russian is known for its high level of **inflectedness**.","translation":"ロシア語はその高い屈折性で知られている。","type":"general","meaning_category":"屈折性"},{"sentence":"The **inflectedness** of Proto-Indo-European has been reconstructed through comparative linguistics.","translation":"印欧祖語の屈折性は、比較言語学を通じて再構築されている。","type":"academic","meaning_category":"屈折性"}]}

This process establishes the three primary germ layers: ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm, which will eventually give rise to all the tissues and organs of the organism.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[],"priority":"★☆☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["gastrula","gastrulation"],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C2","text":"The term 'gastrulated' is highly specialized and primarily encountered within the context of advanced biology, specifically embryology.

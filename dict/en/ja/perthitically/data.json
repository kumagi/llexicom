It means 'in a way that is related to or characteristic of a parenthesis'. A parenthesis is a word, phrase, or sentence inserted as an explanation or afterthought into a passage of writing, usually marked off by brackets, dashes, or commas. Therefore, 'perthitically' describes something that is added as an extra piece of information, not essential to the main point. It is more common to use 'parenthetically' instead."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"She added, perthitically, that the deadline had been extended.","translation":"彼女は、締め切りが延長されたことを、括弧に入れて付け加えた。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"間接的に"},{"sentence":"The author mentioned, perthitically, his previous works.","translation":"著者は、以前の作品について、間接的に言及した。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"付随的に"}]}

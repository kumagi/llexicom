This is in contrast to 'chiral' molecules, which are not superimposable on their mirror images. Nonchiral molecules often possess elements of symmetry, such as a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.","priority":"★★★"},"level_frequency":{"frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency","priority":"★★★"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"Water is a simple example of a nonchiral molecule.","translation":"水はキラルでない分子の簡単な例です。","type":"example","meaning_category":"general"}],"related_words":{"derivatives":["nonchirality"],"related_terms":["stereoisomer","enantiomer","diastereomer"]}}

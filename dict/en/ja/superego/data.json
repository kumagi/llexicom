'Über' means 'over' or 'above', and 'Ich' means 'I' or 'ego'. Thus, 'Über-Ich' literally translates to 'over-I' or 'above-I', representing the part of the psyche that is 'above' the ego in terms of moral authority.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"ˌsuːpərˈiːɡoʊ/","syllables":"su-per-e-go"},"inflection":{"noun_plural":"superegos"},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"The term 'superego' is primarily used within the context of Freudian psychoanalytic theory. It represents the internalized moral standards and values that individuals acquire from their parents and society. The superego acts as a judge or censor of thoughts and actions, leading to feelings of guilt or pride. In everyday language, the term can be used figuratively to describe someone who is excessively moralistic or conscientious.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ He has a very high ego.","correct":"✓ He has a very strong superego.","note":"'Ego' and 'superego' are distinct concepts.

It refers to the part of your mind that tells you what's right and wrong, like a built-in conscience. It develops as you learn rules and values from your parents and society. Sometimes, people use the word to describe someone who always follows the rules and judges others for not doing the same. It's not a word you'd use in everyday conversation unless you're discussing psychology. It is important to understand the context of psychoanalytic theory when using this term.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The child's superego was still developing, so he didn't fully understand the consequences of his actions.","translation":"その子供の超自我はまだ発達段階にあったため、自分の行動の結果を十分に理解していなかった。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"psychoanalytic theory"},{"sentence":"Her superego was so strong that she constantly felt guilty, even for minor mistakes.","translation":"彼女の超自我は非常に強かったため、些細なミスでも常に罪悪感を感じていた。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"psychoanalytic theory"},{"sentence":"He's such a superego; he never bends the rules, even when it would be helpful.","translation":"彼は本当に良心的すぎる。たとえ役に立つとしても、決して規則を曲げない。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"figurative"}]}

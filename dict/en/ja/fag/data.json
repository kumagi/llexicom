The offensive term for a homosexual is of uncertain origin, possibly related to 'faggot' (bundle of sticks) used for burning heretics. The British slang for cigarette is likely a shortening of 'fag-end' (the butt of a cigarette). The verb 'to fag' is related to the noun 'fag' referring to a junior student performing tasks for a senior student in British boarding schools.","priority":"2"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/fæɡ/","syllables":"fag"},"inflection":{"noun_plural":"fags","verb_forms":{"present_simple":["fag","fags"],"past_simple":"fagged","past_participle":"fagged","present_participle":"fagging"}},"usage_notes":"The term 'fag' has multiple meanings depending on the region. In North America, it is a highly offensive slur for a homosexual person. In British English, it can mean a cigarette (though this usage is becoming less common) or, historically, to work hard.

This design results in a smaller size and weight compared to traditional transformers, but it also means that there is no electrical isolation between the input and output. Autotransformers are often used when a small voltage adjustment is needed and efficiency is important. Understanding the concept requires a basic knowledge of electrical engineering principles."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The lab uses an autotransformer to adjust the AC voltage.","translation":"その研究室では、交流電圧を調整するために単巻変圧器を使用しています。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"電気機器"},{"sentence":"The autotransformer efficiently steps down the voltage for the sensitive electronics.","translation":"その単巻変圧器は、敏感な電子機器のために効率的に電圧を降圧します。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"電気機器"}]}

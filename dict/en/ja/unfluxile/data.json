Its usage is limited to specialized fields such as metallurgy, ceramics, or geology, where the melting properties of substances are critical. Due to its infrequent use and technical nature, it is not commonly encountered in general English discourse."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The ceramic material was chosen for its unfluxile properties, ensuring it would maintain its shape at high operating temperatures.","translation":"そのセラミック材料は、高温での動作温度でも形状を維持できるように、融解しない特性のために選ばれました。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"融解しない"}]}

It's essentially a synonym for the more common term 'gemologist'. Because it's so uncommon, it's likely only encountered in highly specialized contexts related to gemology or mineralogy. The prefix 'hemo-' can be misleading, as it usually relates to blood in medical terms, but here it's just part of the word's etymology and doesn't have a direct meaning.

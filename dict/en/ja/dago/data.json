Its origins are uncertain but likely stem from mispronunciations or stereotypes relating to the languages spoken by these communities (e.g., 'Diego' becoming 'dago').  **Do not use this word under any circumstances.** It carries deep historical baggage and perpetuates harmful prejudice.  It’s crucial to be aware of its existence to understand its offensive nature and avoid using it, even in discussions *about* the term itself without explicit condemnation of its hateful connotations."},"related_words":{"derivatives":["dagoboy (rare historical usage - equally offensive)"],"phrasal_verbs":[],"idioms_phrases":[]},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"Not applicable - should not be used","frequency_google_ngram":"Rare, but primarily appears in historical contexts documenting its use as a slur."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"This word is deeply offensive and should never be used.","translation":"この言葉は非常に侮辱的であり、決して使用すべきではありません。","type":"warning","meaning_category":"avoidance"}]}

In linguistics, it's a synonym for 'suffix' – a group of letters added to the end of a word to change its meaning (like '-ing' in 'walking'). In computer science, 'postfix notation' (also called reverse Polish notation) is a way of writing mathematical expressions where the operator comes *after* the numbers it applies to (e.g., '3 4 +' means '3 + 4').

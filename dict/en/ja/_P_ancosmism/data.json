It is closely related to pantheism (汎神論), but while pantheism generally holds that God is *in* everything, pancosmism suggests that God *is* everything, encompassing the entire universe without remainder. It's important to differentiate it from panentheism, which posits that God is greater than the universe, but the universe is contained within God.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Pancosmism is the same as atheism.","correct":"✓ Pancosmism is a belief system that identifies the universe with God, while atheism denies the existence of God.","note":"Pancosmism is a form of theism (belief in God), while atheism is the absence of belief in God."}],"priority":"★☆☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["pancosmic (形容詞: 汎宇宙的な)"],"related_concepts":["pantheism (汎神論)","panentheism (汎有神論)","cosmology (宇宙論)","theology (神学)"],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"非常に低頻度 (Very low frequency)","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C2","text":"Pancosmism is a complex philosophical term that suggests the universe itself is divine.

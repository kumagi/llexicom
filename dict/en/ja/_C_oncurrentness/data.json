It is often used in technical contexts, such as computer science, to describe systems that can handle multiple tasks simultaneously. It is distinct from 'parallelism,' which implies that the tasks are not only happening at the same time, but also making progress at the same time. Concurrentness can exist even on a single-core processor, where tasks are rapidly switched, giving the illusion of simultaneity.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The concurrentness was very high.","correct":"✓ The level of concurrentness was very high.","note":"It's more natural to describe the 'level' or 'degree' of concurrentness rather than just saying 'the concurrentness'."},{"incorrect":"✗ Concurrentness is same as parallelism.","correct":"✓ Concurrentness is related to parallelism, but not the same.","note":"Concurrentness and parallelism are related concepts, but they are not identical.

It can also be used in mathematics and physics to describe systems or phenomena that do not exhibit harmonic relationships. In music, nonharmonic tones are often used to create tension or a sense of unease, which can then be resolved by moving to a harmonic tone or chord.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The song was very non-harmonic and beautiful.","correct":"✓ The song was very dissonant and beautiful.","note":"While nonharmonic elements can be used intentionally, 'nonharmonic' often implies a lack of pleasantness.

It's used when you confirm something based on your own knowledge. For example, you might self-attest your income on a form, meaning you state your income is correct without providing pay stubs. It's common in situations where trust is important, but it's also understood that the information could be checked later. It's a more formal term, so you'll likely encounter it in official documents or professional settings."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The university requires students to submit a self-attestation form regarding their vaccination status.","translation":"大学は学生にワクチン接種状況に関する自己申告書の提出を義務付けている。","type":"general","meaning_category":"自己証明"},{"sentence":"The contractor provided self-attestation of compliance with all safety regulations.","translation":"請負業者はすべての安全規制の遵守に関する自己証明を提出した。","type":"compliance","meaning_category":"自己申告"},{"sentence":"The government agency is piloting a self-attestation system for small business loan applications.","translation":"政府機関は中小企業向け融資申請のための自己申告システムを試験的に導入している。","type":"government","meaning_category":"自己認証"}]}

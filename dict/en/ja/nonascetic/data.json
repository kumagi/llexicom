Asceticism refers to a lifestyle of severe self-discipline and abstention from all forms of indulgence, typically for religious reasons. Therefore, a \"nonascetic\" person or lifestyle is one that does not adhere to these strict practices and may involve enjoying worldly pleasures in moderation. This word is often used in discussions of philosophy, religion, or cultural values.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The king's court was known for its opulent displays and nonascetic lifestyle.","translation":"その王の宮廷は、贅沢な展示と禁欲的でない生活様式で知られていた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"禁欲的でない生活様式"},{"sentence":"She argued for a more balanced approach to life, advocating for nonascetic pleasures alongside spiritual pursuits.","translation":"彼女は人生に対するよりバランスの取れたアプローチを主張し、精神的な追求と並行して禁欲的でない喜びを提唱した。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"禁欲的でない喜び"}]}

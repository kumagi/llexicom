This means that the organism or structure can be divided into two equal halves along two different planes passing through a central axis. Examples of organisms with biradiate symmetry include jellyfish and comb jellies. Understanding this term requires a background in biology or zoology."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The sea anemone exhibits biradiate symmetry, allowing it to sense stimuli from multiple directions.","translation":"イソギンチャクは二放射相称を示し、それによって複数の方向からの刺激を感知することができる。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"二放射相称の"}]}

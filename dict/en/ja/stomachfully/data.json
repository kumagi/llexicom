It is formed by adding the suffix '-ly' to 'stomachful,' meaning 'filled to the stomach.' Its usage is limited to describing actions related to eating or the feeling of being completely full. Due to its rarity, it is unlikely to be encountered in everyday language and is more likely to appear in literary or humorous contexts. Understanding the word requires a good grasp of word formation and a familiarity with less common vocabulary.","priority":"★☆☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The diners sat stomachfully after consuming the massive Thanksgiving feast.","translation":"夕食客たちは感謝祭の大ご馳走を食べた後、お腹いっぱいに座っていた。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"full/satiated"},{"sentence":"He ate stomachfully, savoring the rich flavors of the homemade stew.","translation":"彼は自家製シチューの豊かな風味を味わいながら、お腹いっぱいになるまで食べた。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"eating fully"}]}

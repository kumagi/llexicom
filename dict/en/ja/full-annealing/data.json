It refers to a specific heat treatment process applied to metals to make them softer and more ductile. The process involves heating the metal to a high temperature, holding it there for a period, and then slowly cooling it. This is done to relieve internal stresses and refine the grain structure of the metal. The term is primarily encountered in technical documents, engineering specifications, and academic research related to metallurgy and materials processing."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The aluminum alloy was subjected to full-annealing to improve its formability.","translation":"そのアルミニウム合金は、成形性を向上させるために完全焼鈍処理を施された。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"heat treatment process"},{"sentence":"To ensure the steel's machinability, the manufacturer decided to full-anneal it.","translation":"鋼の機械加工性を確保するために、製造業者はそれを完全焼鈍することに決定した。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"heat treatment process"}]}

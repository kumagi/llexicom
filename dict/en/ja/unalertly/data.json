It's like being on autopilot and not noticing what's happening around you. It's not a very common word, but it's easy to understand if you know what \"alert\" means (being watchful and ready). The \"un-\" prefix makes it the opposite, and the \"-ly\" suffix turns it into an adverb, which describes how someone does something. So, if someone walks \"unalertly,\" they're walking without paying attention."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The hikers, moving unalertly through the forest, were startled by a sudden rustling in the bushes.","translation":"ハイカーたちは不注意に森の中を移動していたため、茂みの中で突然ガサガサと音がして驚いた。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"Without alertness"},{"sentence":"The cashier, working unalertly, gave the customer the wrong change.","translation":"レジ係は不注意に作業していたため、客に間違ったお釣りを渡してしまった。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"Inattentively"},{"sentence":"The driver, glancing unalertly at his phone, nearly rear-ended the car in front of him.","translation":"運転手は不注意に携帯電話に目をやったため、前の車に追突しそうになった。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"Unwarily"}]}

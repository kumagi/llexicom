It implies a lack of active engagement or self-control. The word is relatively uncommon, and its use often suggests a state of apathy, resignation, or being controlled by external forces.

Because it's not a frequently used word, it's more likely to appear in formal writing or literature where the author wants to convey a specific sense of apathy, resignation, or lack of control. Understanding the related words \"will,\" \"willful,\" and \"willfully\" can help clarify the meaning of \"will-lessly.\" The word is most often used to describe the behavior of people, rather than objects."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The prisoner walked will-lessly towards the execution chamber.","translation":"囚人は処刑室に向かって意志なく歩いた。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"Lack of volition"},{"sentence":"She accepted the changes in her life will-lessly, feeling powerless to resist.","translation":"彼女は抵抗する力がないと感じ、人生の変化を意志なく受け入れた。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"Lack of resistance"},{"sentence":"He watched will-lessly as his dreams slipped away.","translation":"彼は自分の夢が消えていくのを意志なく見守った。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"Apathy"}]}

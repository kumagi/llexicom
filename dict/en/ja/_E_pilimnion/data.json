The epilimnion is the warmest layer and is mixed by wind, which keeps the temperature relatively uniform. This term is primarily used in the context of limnology, which is the study of inland waters, and environmental science. Understanding the epilimnion is important for understanding lake ecosystems and water quality."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The temperature of the epilimnion increased significantly during the summer months.","translation":"表水層の温度は夏季に著しく上昇した。","type":"general"},{"sentence":"Nutrient levels in the epilimnion are crucial for phytoplankton growth.","translation":"表水層の栄養レベルは植物プランクトンの成長に重要である。","type":"scientific"}]}

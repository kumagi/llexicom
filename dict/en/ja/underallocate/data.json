It describes the situation where a program or system does not allocate enough resources, typically memory or CPU time, to function correctly or efficiently.

It means to not assign enough of a resource, like memory or processing power, to a task or program. This can cause problems like the program crashing or running very slowly. It's the opposite of 'overallocate', which means assigning too much. This term is mostly used by people who work with computers and software.

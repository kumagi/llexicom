'Dephlegmated' comes from 'dephlegm' (to purify), which is from 'phlegm' (one of the four humors in ancient medicine, associated with coldness and moisture). The term originally related to removing 'phlegm' or impurities.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/ˌʌndiˈflɛɡmeɪtɪd/","syllables":"un-de-phleg-ma-ted"},"inflection":{"notes":"Adjective, no comparative or superlative forms."},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Undephlegmated' is a technical term primarily used in chemistry and chemical engineering. It describes a substance, typically a vapor or liquid mixture, that has not undergone dephlegmation. Dephlegmation is a separation process where a vapor mixture is partially condensed to separate its components based on their boiling points. The term is relatively rare outside of specialized contexts.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The undephlegmated solution was clear.","correct":"✓ The undephlegmated solution was cloudy.","note":"Undephlegmated solutions are more likely to be cloudy due to the presence of impurities.

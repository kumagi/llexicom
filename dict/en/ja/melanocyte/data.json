Their primary function is to produce melanin, a pigment responsible for skin and hair color, and protection against UV radiation. These cells transfer melanin to keratinocytes (the predominant cell type in the epidermis) through melanosomes. The number of melanocytes is relatively consistent across different individuals, but their activity and the type of melanin produced can vary, leading to differences in skin pigmentation. Melanocytes are also involved in certain skin disorders and cancers, such as melanoma.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Melanocytes are a type of keratinocyte.","correct":"✓ Melanocytes and keratinocytes are different types of cells in the skin.","note":"Melanocytes produce melanin, while keratinocytes are the main structural cells of the epidermis.

It's an intracellular parasite, meaning it lives inside the cells of its host. Wolbachia is notable for its ability to manipulate the reproduction of its hosts, leading to phenomena like cytoplasmic incompatibility, feminization, male killing, and parthenogenesis. These reproductive manipulations can influence the evolution and population dynamics of its hosts. Wolbachia is also being explored as a potential tool for controlling insect-borne diseases, such as dengue fever and Zika virus, by introducing Wolbachia into mosquito populations to reduce their ability to transmit these viruses.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Wolbach is a virus.","correct":"✓ Wolbachia is a bacterium.","note":"Wolbachia is a bacterium, not a virus."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["Wolbachia pipientis (ヴォルバキア・ピピエンティス - 最も研究されている種)"],"phrasal_verbs":["none"],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency","priority":"☆☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"「**Wolbachia**」は、節足動物（昆虫、クモなど）や線虫に感染する細菌の一種の名前です。細胞内共生体であり、宿主の生殖を操作する能力で知られています。科学や生物学の分野で使われる専門用語であり、一般的な会話ではほとんど使われません。昆虫媒介性疾患の制御への応用も研究されています。"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"Researchers are studying how **Wolbachia** affects mosquito reproduction.","translation":"研究者たちは、ヴォルバキアが蚊の繁殖にどのように影響するかを研究しています。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"細菌"},{"sentence":"Introducing **Wolbachia** into mosquito populations could help control dengue fever.","translation":"蚊の個体群にヴォルバキアを導入することで、デング熱の抑制に役立つ可能性があります。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"細菌"}]}

This occurs because the sugar can exist in two different anomeric forms (α and β), which interconvert in solution. The rate and extent of mutarotation depend on factors such as temperature, pH, and the presence of catalysts.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Mutarotation only happens in amino acids.","correct":"✓ Mutarotation happens in cyclic sugars.","note":"Mutarotation is characteristic of cyclic sugars, not amino acids."},{"incorrect":"✗ Mutarotation is a type of hydrolysis.","correct":"✓ Mutarotation is a change in optical rotation due to anomer interconversion.","note":"Mutarotation is not a hydrolysis reaction; it's a change in the equilibrium between anomers."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["mutarotase"],"phrasal_verbs":[],"related_terms":["anomer","anomeric carbon","optical rotation","polarimeter","epimer"]},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C1","frequency_google_ngram":"Low","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"Mutarotation is a term used in organic chemistry and biochemistry to describe the change in optical rotation of a solution of certain sugars over time.

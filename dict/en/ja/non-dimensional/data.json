It describes quantities or equations that have been normalized to remove their physical units, making them easier to compare and analyze across different scales or systems. The process of making a quantity non-dimensional is called non-dimensionalization.","priority":"☆☆☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"The non-dimensional equation has units.","correct":"The non-dimensional equation has no units.","note":"A non-dimensional equation, by definition, does not have physical units."}],"priority":"☆☆☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low","priority":"☆☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"The term 'non-dimensional' is a technical term used in scientific and engineering fields to describe quantities that do not have physical dimensions (e.g., length, mass, time).

It is Italian for 'little neutral one'. The 'neutr-' part comes from 'neutral', referring to the particle's lack of electric charge, and the '-ino' suffix is an Italian diminutive, indicating that it was thought to be a small particle.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/nuːˈtriːnoʊz/","syllables":"nu-tri-noes"},"inflection":{"noun_plural":"neutrinos"},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Neutrinos' are fundamental particles in physics, belonging to the lepton family. They are known for their extremely small mass and their weak interaction with other matter, making them very difficult to detect.

They are produced in various nuclear processes, such as those occurring in the sun and in nuclear reactors. Due to their weak interactions, neutrinos are notoriously difficult to detect, requiring large and sophisticated detectors. The study of neutrinos is an active area of research in particle physics and astrophysics, as they can provide insights into fundamental properties of the universe and the nature of matter. Understanding neutrinos requires a background in physics and an understanding of the Standard Model of particle physics."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The experiment aims to detect the flux of solar neutrinos.","translation":"その実験は太陽ニュートリノのフラックスを検出することを目的としています。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"素粒子"},{"sentence":"Neutrinos are produced in the core of the sun through nuclear fusion.","translation":"ニュートリノは太陽の中心部で核融合によって生成されます。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"素粒子"},{"sentence":"The phenomenon of neutrino oscillation proves that neutrinos have mass.","translation":"ニュートリノ振動の現象は、ニュートリノが質量を持つことを証明しています。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"素粒子"},{"sentence":"Scientists are building larger neutrino detectors to study these elusive particles.","translation":"科学者たちは、これらのとらえどころのない粒子を研究するために、より大きなニュートリノ検出器を建設しています。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"素粒子"}]}

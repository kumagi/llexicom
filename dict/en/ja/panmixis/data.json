It implies that any individual is equally likely to mate with any other individual, regardless of genotype or phenotype. This assumption is often used in theoretical models, although it rarely holds perfectly true in natural populations due to factors such as geographic structure, behavioral preferences, and assortative mating.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Panmixis is when organisms choose their mates.","correct":"✓ Panmixis is when organisms mate randomly.","note":"Panmixis implies random mating, not mate choice."},{"incorrect":"✗ Panmixis leads to less genetic diversity.","correct":"✓ Panmixis leads to more genetic diversity.","note":"Panmixis promotes genetic mixing and thus increases diversity."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["panmictic (adjective)"],"phrasal_verbs":[],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Panmixis' is a technical term used in biology, specifically in population genetics.

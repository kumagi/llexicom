The first, and perhaps more common, meaning relates to the shape of an ellipse, which is a flattened circle or oval. The second meaning refers to something that is characterized by ellipsis, meaning that words or phrases are deliberately omitted from a sentence or expression, often because they are understood from the context. When used in this second sense, \"elliptic\" can also imply that something is concise or even obscure due to the omission of information.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The speaker's style was very elliptical, making it hard to follow.","correct":"✓ The speaker's style was very elliptic, making it hard to follow.","note":"While 'elliptical' and 'elliptic' are sometimes used interchangeably to describe something characterized by ellipsis, 'elliptic' is generally preferred in technical contexts, especially in mathematics.

First, it describes something shaped like an ellipse, which is a flattened circle or oval. Second, it describes language that uses ellipsis, meaning that some words are left out because they are understood from the context.

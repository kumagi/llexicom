It implies that while there is some reduction in worry, anxiety, or negative feelings, the relief is not complete. The prefix 'quasi-' suggests an approximation or resemblance to the state of being fully relieved.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ She felt quasi relieved and happy.","correct":"✓ She felt quasi-relieved and somewhat happy.","note":"Since 'quasi-relieved' already implies partial relief, adding a strong adjective like 'happy' can be contradictory. Using 'somewhat happy' maintains the nuance of partiality."},{"incorrect":"✗ He was quasi-relieved to do the task.","correct":"✓ He was quasi-relieved that the task was over.","note":"The adjective 'quasi-relieved' describes a feeling or state of being, not an action.

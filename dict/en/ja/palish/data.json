It is used to describe something that has a light or faint pale color, but not intensely so. It is formed by adding the suffix '-ish' to the word 'pale', which indicates a slight degree of the quality. Because it's less common, it's more likely to be encountered in written texts or in situations where precise color descriptions are needed. Understanding the base word 'pale' is essential for understanding 'palish'."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The newborn's skin had a palish hue.","translation":"新生児の肌はやや青白い色合いだった。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"color"},{"sentence":"The old curtains were a palish yellow from years of sun exposure.","translation":"古いカーテンは長年の日光曝露で薄い黄色になっていた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"color"},{"sentence":"After being indoors for weeks, his face looked palish.","translation":"数週間屋内にいた後、彼の顔は青白く見えた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"appearance"}]}

Its meaning can be understood from its components: \"sense\" referring to the five senses, and \"distracted\" meaning having one's attention drawn away. Therefore, it generally describes someone whose attention is easily diverted by sensory stimuli. A secondary, less common meaning refers to a state of being deprived of one's senses, similar to being unconscious.

It describes someone whose attention is easily diverted by sensory input, such as sights, sounds, or smells. Because it is uncommon, it's important to understand the meaning of its component parts (\"sense\" and \"distracted\") to infer its overall meaning. It can also, more rarely, mean deprived of one's senses. Due to its rarity, it's best used in contexts where the meaning is clear or can be easily inferred."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The sense-distracted tourist nearly walked into oncoming traffic while admiring the architecture.","translation":"感覚的な刺激に気を取られた観光客は、建築物を鑑賞しているうちに、危うく対向車にぶつかりそうになった。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"attention diverted"},{"sentence":"After the accident, he remained sense-distracted for several hours, unable to recall what had happened.","translation":"事故後、彼は数時間感覚を失った状態が続き、何が起こったのかを思い出すことができなかった。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"deprived of senses"},{"sentence":"She found it difficult to meditate in the park, as she was easily sense-distracted by the birds singing and the children playing.","translation":"彼女は公園で瞑想するのが難しいと感じた。なぜなら、鳥のさえずりや子供たちの遊ぶ声にすぐに気を取られてしまうからだ。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"attention diverted"}]}

It is a relatively uncommon word and is typically used in formal or academic contexts. To understand its meaning, one must first understand the meaning of \"persuasive,\" which means able to convince someone to do or believe something. The addition of the prefix \"un-\" reverses this meaning, and the suffix \"-ness\" turns it into a noun. Therefore, \"unpersuasiveness\" refers to the state or quality of not being able to convince or influence someone."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The committee cited the unpersuasiveness of the data as the reason for rejecting the proposal.","translation":"委員会は、提案を却下した理由として、データの説得力のなさを挙げた。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"説得力がないこと"},{"sentence":"The speaker's unpersuasiveness was due to his monotone delivery and lack of eye contact.","translation":"講演者の説得力のなさは、彼の単調な話し方とアイコンタクトの欠如が原因だった。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"説得力がないこと"},{"sentence":"Despite her best efforts, the unpersuasiveness of her plea failed to sway the judge's decision.","translation":"彼女の最善の努力にもかかわらず、彼女の嘆願の説得力のなさは、裁判官の決定を覆すことができなかった。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"説得力がないこと"}]}

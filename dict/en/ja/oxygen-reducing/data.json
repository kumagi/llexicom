'Reducing' refers to the chemical process of reduction, where a substance gains electrons. In this case, the substance gains electrons from oxygen, effectively reducing the oxygen's oxidation state.","priority":"★★★"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/ˈɒksɪdʒən rɪˈdjuːsɪŋ/","syllables":"ox-y-gen re-duc-ing"},"inflection":{"notes":"Adjectives do not inflect in English."},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"The term 'oxygen-reducing' describes a substance or process that causes oxygen to undergo reduction.

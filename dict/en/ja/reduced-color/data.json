This is often done to decrease the file size of the image, which can be useful for web design or other applications where storage space or bandwidth is limited. While reducing the number of colors can make an image load faster, it can also result in a loss of detail and the appearance of color banding or other visual artifacts. The term is most commonly used in the context of digital image processing and computer graphics.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The artist created a unique effect by using a reduced-color filter on the photograph.","translation":"アーティストは、写真に減色フィルターを使用することで、ユニークな効果を生み出した。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"減色された"},{"sentence":"The software offers several options for reduced-color conversion.","translation":"そのソフトウェアは、減色変換のためのいくつかのオプションを提供する。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"減色"}]}

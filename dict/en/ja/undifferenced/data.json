It describes data or a series that has not undergone the process of differencing. Differencing is a transformation applied to time series data to make it stationary (i.e., to remove trends or seasonality). Therefore, 'undifferenced' refers to the original data before this transformation. It is important to specify 'undifferenced' when discussing data that could potentially be differenced to avoid ambiguity.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The undifferenced data is better because it's more smooth.","correct":"✓ The undifferenced data is better because it preserves the original trend.","note":"Undifferenced data is not necessarily 'better' or 'smoother'.

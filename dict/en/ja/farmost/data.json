It is not commonly used in modern English, and 'farthest' is generally preferred. Its usage is typically limited to formal or literary contexts. It is more frequently encountered in older texts or specialized fields such as geography or exploration. Because of its rarity, it is more likely to be understood by advanced English speakers or those familiar with older vocabulary. 'Farmost' is formed by combining 'far' with the superlative suffix '-most', similar to 'foremost' and 'utmost'."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The farmost star visible to the naked eye is very faint.","translation":"肉眼で見える最も遠い星は非常に薄暗い。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"distance"},{"sentence":"They explored farmost into the uncharted territory.","translation":"彼らは未踏の地を最も遠くまで探検した。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"distance"}]}

It often implies that the combination is practical, logical, or beneficial. The term is frequently used in technical or scientific contexts, such as chemistry, mathematics, and computer science, but can also be applied more broadly to describe any elements that can be effectively united.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The combinable of these ingredients creates a delicious dish.","correct":"✓ The combination of these ingredients creates a delicious dish.","note":"'Combinable' is an adjective, so it describes a quality of the ingredients.

It is often used in technical contexts to describe whether different parts or elements can be effectively combined.

This word is not commonly used in everyday conversation, so it's more important for those studying science or related fields to understand its meaning."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The enzyme's activity becomes saturable at high substrate concentrations.","translation":"酵素の活性は、基質濃度が高いと飽和可能になる。","type":"scientific context","meaning_category":"飽和可能な"},{"sentence":"The soil's capacity to absorb water is saturable.","translation":"土壌の水を吸収する能力は飽和可能である。","type":"environmental science","meaning_category":"飽和可能な"},{"sentence":"The market for smartphones is becoming increasingly saturable.","translation":"スマートフォン市場はますます飽和状態になりつつある。","type":"economic context","meaning_category":"飽和可能な"}]}

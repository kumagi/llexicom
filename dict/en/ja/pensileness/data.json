It's formed by combining 'pencil' with '-less' (meaning without) and '-ness' (denoting a state or quality). Due to its rarity, it's not commonly used in everyday conversation or writing, but it might appear in creative or descriptive contexts to emphasize the absence of pencils. It is generally understood because of its straightforward construction, but more common phrases like 'lack of pencils' or 'pencil shortage' are typically preferred."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The artist lamented the pensileness of her studio, unable to sketch her initial ideas.","translation":"そのアーティストは、スタジオに鉛筆がないことを嘆き、最初のアイデアをスケッチすることができなかった。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"lack of pencils"},{"sentence":"The report highlighted the pensileness in rural schools, affecting students' educational outcomes.","translation":"その報告書は、地方の学校における鉛筆不足を強調し、生徒の教育成果に影響を与えている。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"lack of pencils"}]}

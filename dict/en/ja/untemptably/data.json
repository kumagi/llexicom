It's formed from 'tempt' (to entice or lure), '-able' (capable of being), 'un-' (not), and '-ly' (adverbial suffix). The word suggests a deliberate and strong resistance to being tempted, often in situations where something desirable but forbidden is present. Due to its rarity and complexity, it is not commonly used in everyday language and is more likely to be found in formal writing or literature."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"She arranged the cookies untemptably, knowing her children were trying to avoid sugar.","translation":"彼女は子供たちが砂糖を避けようとしているのを知っていたので、クッキーを誘惑されないように並べた。","type":"general","meaning_category":"resisting temptation"},{"sentence":"The monk lived untemptably in his secluded monastery, far from worldly distractions.","translation":"その僧侶は世俗的な気晴らしから遠く離れた人里離れた修道院で、誘惑に負けないように暮らしていた。","type":"literary","meaning_category":"avoiding vice"}]}

It refers to a specific type of verse that has a 'limping' or irregular rhythm, typically due to a spondee or trochee replacing the final iamb in an iambic pentameter line. Because of its niche usage within literary criticism and classical poetry, it's not a word encountered in general English."},"example_sentences":[]}

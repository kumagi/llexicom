It refers to the study of the past geographical distribution of plants, often involving the analysis of fossil records and geological data to understand how plant species have spread and evolved over time. Due to its specific and technical nature, it is not commonly encountered outside of academic or research contexts. Understanding this term requires familiarity with basic concepts in plant biology, geology, and evolutionary history."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The palaeochorology of ferns reveals their ancient presence on multiple continents.","translation":"シダの古植物地理学は、複数の大陸におけるそれらの古代からの存在を明らかにしています。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"古植物地理学"},{"sentence":"Palaeochorological studies can help predict how plant species might respond to future climate change.","translation":"古植物地理学的研究は、植物種が将来の気候変動にどのように対応するかを予測するのに役立ちます。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"古植物地理学"}]}

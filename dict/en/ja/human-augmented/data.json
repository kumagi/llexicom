Comparative and superlative forms could be 'more human-augmented' and 'most human-augmented', but these are not commonly used."},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Human-augmented' is a relatively new term that has gained prominence with the rise of artificial intelligence and advanced technologies. It emphasizes the idea that technology should be used to enhance human capabilities rather than replace them entirely. It is often used in the context of AI, automation, and other technologies that are designed to work alongside humans. The term highlights the importance of human involvement, oversight, and control in technological systems.","priority":"N/A"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The system is fully human-augmented.","correct":"✓ The system is human-augmented.","note":"'Fully human-augmented' is redundant. The term already implies enhancement, so 'fully' is unnecessary. Instead, focus on what aspect is augmented or the extent of augmentation."},{"incorrect":"✗ Human-augmented is better than human.","correct":"✓ Human-augmented systems are better than human-only systems.","note":"When comparing, specify what is being compared. 'Human-augmented' is an adjective, so it needs to modify a noun (e.g., systems, processes, capabilities) for the comparison to make sense."},{"incorrect":"✗ The AI is human-augmented.","correct":"✓ The system uses human-augmented intelligence.","note":"AI itself is not human-augmented; rather, AI can be used to augment human capabilities. Therefore, it's more accurate to say that a system or process utilizes human-augmented intelligence."}],"priority":"N/A"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["augmentation (noun)","augment (verb)"],"phrasal_verbs":[],"related_terms":["artificial intelligence (AI)","machine learning","human-computer interaction (HCI)","augmented reality (AR)","virtual reality (VR)","assistive technology","cognitive enhancement"],"priority":"N/A"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"N/A","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency - This term is relatively new and not yet widely used.","priority":"N/A"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Human-augmented' describes situations where technology is used to make people better at what they do. Instead of technology replacing humans, it helps them perform tasks more effectively or efficiently. Think of it as technology giving people superpowers in their jobs or daily lives.

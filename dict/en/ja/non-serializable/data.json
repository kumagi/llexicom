It describes data or objects that cannot be converted into a format suitable for storage (e.g., in a file or database) or transmission (e.g., over a network). Serialization is the process of converting the state of an object into a byte stream, which can then be deserialized to recreate the object. Objects might be non-serializable because they contain references to resources that are specific to a particular environment (like file handles or network connections) or because their class definition explicitly prevents serialization.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The data is non-serialize.","correct":"✓ The data is non-serializable.","note":"The correct adjective form is 'non-serializable', not 'non-serialize'."},{"incorrect":"✗ The object is non-serialisation.","correct":"✓ The object is non-serializable.","note":"'Non-serialisation' is a noun referring to the *process* of not serializing, while 'non-serializable' is an adjective describing something that *cannot* be serialized."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["serialization","deserialize","serializable","non-serialization"],"related_concepts":["object serialization","data serialization","transient fields"],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2 (Technical vocabulary)","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency - primarily used in technical contexts.","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Non-serializable' is a technical term used in computer programming. It describes something that cannot be converted into a stream of data (like bytes) that can be saved to a file or sent over a network. Imagine you have a complex toy made of many parts. Serialization is like taking that toy apart and writing down instructions on how to put it back together. If a part of the toy is glued in place and can't be taken apart, then the entire toy is 'non-serializable' – you can't write down instructions to recreate it perfectly. In programming, objects that depend on specific computer resources (like open files or network connections) are often non-serializable because those resources might not exist or be valid when you try to recreate the object later.

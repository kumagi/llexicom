Ozone, a form of oxygen, can cause rubber to crack and degrade over time, especially when exposed to the atmosphere. Antiozonants work by reacting with ozone before it can attack the rubber, or by forming a protective layer on the surface of the material. These additives are crucial in extending the lifespan and maintaining the performance of rubber products such as tires, seals, and hoses.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The antiozonant was used to prevent rust on the metal.","correct":"✓ The antiozonant was used to prevent ozone degradation of the rubber.","note":"Antiozonants are specifically for protecting against ozone degradation, not rust or other forms of corrosion."},{"incorrect":"✗ The antiozonant is a type of plastic.","correct":"✓ The antiozonant is a chemical additive.","note":"Antiozonants are chemical additives, not a type of plastic or the primary material itself."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["antiozonant wax","antiozonant protection"],"phrasal_verbs":[],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"The word \"antiozonant\" is a technical term primarily used in the fields of chemistry, materials science, and engineering, specifically related to rubber and polymer technology. It refers to a chemical substance added to materials, especially rubber, to prevent or slow down degradation caused by ozone exposure.

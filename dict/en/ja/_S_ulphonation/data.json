This process is widely used in industrial chemistry for the production of various products, including detergents, dyes, pharmaceuticals, and polymers. The reaction typically involves the use of a sulfonating agent, such as sulfuric acid, oleum, or sulfur trioxide. The position of the sulfonic acid group on the molecule can affect the properties and reactivity of the resulting sulfonated compound.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The sulphonation is very quiet.","correct":"✓ The sulphonation reaction is very slow.","note":"'Sulphonation' refers to a chemical process, not a state of being quiet.

It describes something, usually a document or piece of information, that has not been distributed to its intended audience. Understanding the word requires familiarity with the base verb 'circularize,' which means to send something to a number of people. The prefix 'un-' negates this action, indicating that the distribution did not occur. Due to its specialized usage, it is more likely to be encountered in written materials related to business, government, or academic settings."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The uncircularized policy changes led to confusion among the staff.","translation":"回覧されなかった方針の変更は、職員の間に混乱を引き起こした。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"Not circulated"},{"sentence":"Due to budget constraints, the newsletter remained uncircularized this quarter.","translation":"予算の制約により、今四半期はニュースレターが回覧されなかった。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"Not circulated"}]}

It means to find out how much a set of data is related to itself over time. Imagine you have a series of numbers that change over days. If you autocorrelate them, you're checking if the numbers today are similar to the numbers from yesterday, or the day before. This helps find patterns in the data. It's a more advanced concept, so you'll typically encounter it in specialized areas of study."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The scientist used a computer program to autocorrelate the weather data.","translation":"科学者は、気象データを自己相関させるためにコンピュータープログラムを使用しました。","type":"verb (vt)","meaning_category":"自己相関させる"},{"sentence":"The stock prices autocorrelate over short periods, but not over longer ones.","translation":"株価は短期間では自己相関しますが、長期間では自己相関しません。","type":"verb (vi)","meaning_category":"自己相関関係を持つ"}]}

'Completion' in the context of oil and gas wells refers to the process of making a well ready for production after drilling has been completed.

It refers to the process of modifying an existing well to either produce from a different geological zone or to enhance production from the current zone.

Recompletion is often a more cost-effective alternative to drilling a new well.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The recompletion was completed new.","correct":"✓ The recompletion was completed.","note":"The word 'recompletion' already implies that it is being done again, so adding 'new' is redundant."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["complete","completion","recomplete"],"phrasal_verbs":[]},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C2","text":"The term 'recompletion' is highly specialized and primarily used within the oil and gas industry.

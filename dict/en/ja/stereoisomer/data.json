This contrasts with structural isomers, which share the same molecular formula, but the bond connections or their order differs. Stereoisomers include enantiomers (non-superimposable mirror images) and diastereomers (stereoisomers that are not enantiomers). The study and manipulation of stereoisomers are crucial in fields like chemistry, biology, and pharmacology, as different stereoisomers can exhibit vastly different biological activities.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Stereoisomers have different molecular formulas.","correct":"✓ Stereoisomers have the same molecular formula.","note":"Stereoisomers share the same molecular formula but differ in spatial arrangement."},{"incorrect":"✗ All isomers are stereoisomers.","correct":"✓ Not all isomers are stereoisomers.

Think of it like having the same Lego bricks, but building different structures with them. It's important in chemistry and biology because these different arrangements can cause molecules to behave differently, especially in the body. There are two main types: enantiomers (mirror images that can't be superimposed) and diastereomers (everything else)."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The reaction yields a mixture of stereoisomers that must be separated.","translation":"その反応では、分離する必要のある立体異性体の混合物が生成されます。","type":"general","meaning_category":"chemical reaction"},{"sentence":"Understanding the stereoisomeric properties of a drug is essential for predicting its efficacy.","translation":"薬物の立体異性体の特性を理解することは、その有効性を予測するために不可欠です。","type":"pharmaceutical","meaning_category":"drug properties"},{"sentence":"Enzymes often exhibit high stereospecificity, interacting with only one stereoisomer of a substrate.","translation":"酵素は多くの場合、高い立体特異性を示し、基質の1つの立体異性体のみと相互作用します。","type":"biochemistry","meaning_category":"enzyme interaction"}]}

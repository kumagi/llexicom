In theology, it refers to the unlimited power or capability of a divine being. In biology, specifically in stem cell research, it describes the ability of a stem cell to differentiate into any cell type derived from the three germ layers (ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm). It is a slightly less broad term than 'totipotency', which includes the ability to form extraembryonic tissues like the placenta.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The pluripotency of the government was evident in its swift response.","correct":"✓ The power of the government was evident in its swift response.","note":"While 'pluripotence' can refer to general power, it's more commonly used in specific scientific or theological contexts.

In programming, it refers to a property of an object that will not show up when you loop through the object's properties. In mathematics, it refers to a set that cannot be counted because it is infinitely large in a way that prevents a one-to-one correspondence with the natural numbers. Understanding this term requires familiarity with object-oriented programming concepts and basic set theory."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The `length` property of an array is typically non-enumerable.","translation":"配列の `length` プロパティは通常、列挙不可です。","type":"programming","meaning_category":"列挙できない"},{"sentence":"The set of all functions from the natural numbers to {0, 1} is non-enumerable.","translation":"自然数から{0, 1}へのすべての関数の集合は非可算です。","type":"mathematics","meaning_category":"非可算の"}]}

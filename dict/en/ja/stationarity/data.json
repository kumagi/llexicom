It describes a situation where something doesn't change over time. Imagine a graph where the average value stays the same, no matter how far along the graph you look. That's stationarity. It's important in things like predicting the stock market or understanding weather patterns. If something is stationary, it makes it easier to analyze and predict. If it's not stationary, you might need to do some extra steps to make it stationary before you can use certain methods.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The assumption of stationarity is fundamental to many time series models.","translation":"定常性の仮定は、多くの時系列モデルにとって基礎となります。","type":"general","meaning_category":"定常性"},{"sentence":"We applied a differencing technique to achieve stationarity in the data.","translation":"データの定常性を実現するために、階差法を適用しました。","type":"technical","meaning_category":"定常性"},{"sentence":"The ADF test is commonly used to check for stationarity in economic time series.","translation":"ADF検定は、経済時系列の定常性を確認するためによく使用されます。","type":"technical","meaning_category":"定常性"}]}

It's used to describe actions or statements that are unfair because they don't have a good reason or basis. Because it is a more formal and complex word, it is more common in written English, especially in legal or academic contexts, than in everyday conversation. It is formed by adding the prefix 'un-' and the suffix '-ly' to the word 'warrantable,' which means 'justifiable.'"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The media was unwarrantably intrusive into her private life.","translation":"メディアは彼女の私生活に不当に立ち入った。","type":"general"},{"sentence":"The punishment seemed unwarrantably severe for such a minor offense.","translation":"その処罰は、そのような軽微な違反に対して不当に厳しすぎるように思われた。","type":"general"},{"sentence":"The accusations were dismissed as unwarrantably speculative.","translation":"その告発は、根拠のない憶測として退けられた。","type":"legal"}]}

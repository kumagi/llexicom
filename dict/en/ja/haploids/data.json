It refers to cells or organisms that possess only one set of chromosomes, as opposed to the usual two sets found in diploid organisms. Understanding this term requires a background in basic genetics. It's commonly encountered in discussions of meiosis, genetic mutations, and certain types of organisms like fungi and algae that can exist in a haploid state.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The male drone bee is haploid.","translation":"雄のミツバチのオスは半数体である。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"生物学"},{"sentence":"Haploid plants can be generated through various techniques.","translation":"半数体植物は様々な技術を通じて生成できる。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"生物学"}]}

When you save files, they can get scattered in different places. Defragmenting puts them back together, so the computer can find them faster. If a hard drive is 'defragmentable', it means you can do this tidying up process to make it run better."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"Is this SSD defragmentable, or will defragmentation reduce its lifespan?","translation":"このSSDはデフラグ可能ですか、それともデフラグによって寿命が短くなりますか？","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"capable of being defragmented"},{"sentence":"Older hard drives are typically more defragmentable than newer solid-state drives.","translation":"古いハードドライブは通常、新しいソリッドステートドライブよりもデフラグ可能です。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"capable of being defragmented"}]}

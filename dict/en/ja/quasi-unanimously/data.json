It is formed by adding the prefix 'quasi-' (meaning 'resembling' or 'almost') to 'unanimously'. This term is typically used in formal or academic contexts to provide a nuanced description of a decision or vote where the support is very strong but not perfectly unanimous. It implies that while there may have been some dissent, it was minimal or insignificant enough to consider the outcome as being very close to unanimous."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The city council voted quasi-unanimously to approve the new zoning regulations.","translation":"市議会は新しいゾーニング規制を承認するためにほぼ満場一致で投票した。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"agreement"},{"sentence":"The scientific community quasi-unanimously supports the theory of climate change.","translation":"科学界は気候変動の理論をほぼ満場一致で支持している。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"support"}]}

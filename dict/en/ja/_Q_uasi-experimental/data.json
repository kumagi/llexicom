The main difference is that in a real experiment, people are randomly put into different groups (like a treatment group and a control group). In quasi-experimental research, this random assignment doesn't happen, often because it's not possible or ethical. This makes it harder to be sure that any differences seen are actually caused by the thing being studied, as other factors might be at play.

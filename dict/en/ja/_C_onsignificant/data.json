Due to its rarity, it is primarily found in academic or technical writing. Understanding its Latin roots ('con-' meaning 'with', and 'significare' meaning 'to signify') can help in grasping its meaning. It is important to distinguish its usage as an adjective from the related noun 'significance' and to avoid using a non-existent adverbial form like 'consignificantly.'"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The ethical and economic implications are consignificant in this policy decision.","translation":"倫理的および経済的な影響は、この政策決定において同じくらい重要である。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"equivalent importance"},{"sentence":"In the context of this study, the variables 'A' and 'B' are treated as consignificant.","translation":"この研究の文脈では、変数「A」と「B」は同等の意味を持つものとして扱われる。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"equivalent meaning"}]}

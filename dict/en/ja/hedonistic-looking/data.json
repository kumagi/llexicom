It combines the concept of 'hedonistic' (related to hedonism, the pursuit of pleasure) with 'looking' (having a particular appearance). This term is not commonly used and would be understood by those with a strong vocabulary. It is more descriptive than simply using 'hedonistic' as it specifies that the appearance is what conveys the sense of pleasure-seeking."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The spa offered a hedonistic-looking array of treatments designed to pamper and relax.","translation":"そのスパは、甘やかしとリラックスを目的とした、快楽主義的に見える様々なトリートメントを提供していた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"appearance of pleasure"},{"sentence":"The decadent cake had a hedonistic-looking glaze that made it irresistible.","translation":"その退廃的なケーキは、たまらなく魅力的な、快楽主義的に見える艶出しが施されていた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"appearance of pleasure"},{"sentence":"The villa had a hedonistic-looking pool area with plush lounge chairs and a swim-up bar.","translation":"その別荘には、豪華なラウンジチェアとスイムアップバーを備えた、快楽主義的に見えるプールエリアがあった。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"appearance of pleasure"}]}

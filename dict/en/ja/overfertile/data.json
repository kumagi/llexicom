It is often used in agricultural or environmental contexts to indicate that soil or land is too rich in nutrients, which can lead to problems such as rapid weed growth or imbalances in plant growth. The term implies a negative consequence of excessive fertility, rather than simply indicating high fertility. Understanding the prefix \"over-\" and the root word \"fertile\" is helpful in deciphering the meaning.","example_sentences":[]}}

It's used to express a sense of 'almost' or 'sort of' romantic behavior or atmosphere. Because it uses the prefix 'quasi-' and the adverb 'romantically,' understanding those components can help in grasping its meaning. It's more often found in formal writing or discussions about relationships and artistic depictions of relationships."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The candlelight dinner was quasi-romantically lit, with soft music playing in the background.","translation":"キャンドルライトディナーは、準ロマンチックに照らされ、バックグラウンドでソフトな音楽が流れていました。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"manner"},{"sentence":"She quasi-romantically hinted at her feelings, never directly confessing her love.","translation":"彼女は自分の気持ちを準ロマンチックにほのめかしましたが、決して直接愛を告白しませんでした。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"manner"}]}

It implies that even if defamatory statements are made, the person or entity is unlikely to win a libel case. This can be due to several factors, such as the person's already tarnished reputation, the difficulty of proving the statements false, or the high legal threshold for public figures to prove actual malice. The concept is controversial, as it can be seen as giving the media more leeway to publish potentially damaging information about certain individuals.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The libel-resistant material was published online.","correct":"✓ The libelous material was published online.","note":"'Libel-resistant' describes a person or entity, not the material itself.

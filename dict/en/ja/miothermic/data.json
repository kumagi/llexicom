In biology, it describes organisms that thrive in moderate temperatures. In paleontology, it is a less common term used to describe organisms, especially certain dinosaurs, that may have had some ability to regulate their body temperature but were still significantly influenced by the environment. It is important to note that the term is not widely used in paleontology, and the concept is often discussed using other terms such as 'mesothermic' or 'heterothermic'.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The miothermic animal was found in the arctic.","correct":"✓ The miothermic animal was found in a temperate region.","note":"Miothermic animals prefer moderate temperatures and would not typically be found in extremely cold environments like the arctic."}],"priority":"★☆☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["miotherm (noun - a miothermic organism)"],"phrasal_verbs":[],"priority":"★☆☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2 (specialized vocabulary)","frequency_google_ngram":"Very low frequency.","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Miothermic' is a technical term used in biology and paleontology to describe organisms that prefer or are adapted to moderate temperatures.

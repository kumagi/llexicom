While grammatically correct, it is less commonly used than 'differently.' It's important to understand its meaning, but it's generally better to use 'differently' or rephrase the sentence for clearer communication. For example, instead of saying 'They approached the task differingly,' you could say 'They approached the task in different ways' or 'They had different approaches to the task.'"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The witnesses described the event differingly, leading to confusion about what actually happened.","translation":"目撃者たちはその出来事を異なって説明し、実際に何が起こったのかについて混乱が生じました。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"異なるように"},{"sentence":"The researchers interpreted the data differingly, resulting in conflicting conclusions.","translation":"研究者たちはそのデータを異なって解釈し、矛盾する結論に至りました。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"違って"}]}

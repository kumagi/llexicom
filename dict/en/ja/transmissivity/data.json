In hydrology, it describes how easily water flows through an aquifer. It's calculated by multiplying hydraulic conductivity (how well water flows through the material) by the aquifer's thickness. In physics, it describes how well a material transmits light or other electromagnetic radiation. Understanding this word requires a background in either hydrology or physics.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The high transmissivity of the sandstone aquifer allows for significant groundwater extraction.","translation":"その砂岩帯水層の高い透水係数は、大量の地下水採取を可能にする。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"Hydrology"},{"sentence":"The transmissivity of the optical fiber is crucial for efficient data transfer.","translation":"光ファイバーの透過率は、効率的なデータ伝送にとって非常に重要である。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"Optics"},{"sentence":"Pumping tests were conducted to estimate the transmissivity of the confined aquifer.","translation":"被圧帯水層の透水係数を推定するために、揚水試験が実施された。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"Hydrology"},{"sentence":"The atmospheric transmissivity varies depending on the amount of aerosols and clouds present.","translation":"大気の透過率は、存在するエアロゾルと雲の量によって変化する。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"Atmospheric Physics"}]}

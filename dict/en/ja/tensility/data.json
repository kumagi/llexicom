It is closely related to 'tensile strength,' which is the maximum stress a material can withstand while being stretched or pulled before failing or breaking. While 'tensility' describes the general quality, 'tensile strength' provides a quantitative measure. The term is primarily used in engineering, materials science, and physics.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The tensility of water is very high.","correct":"✓ The surface tension of water is very high.","note":"'Tensility' refers to the ability to withstand pulling forces, not surface tension.

It's similar to 'stretchiness' but is used more in scientific and engineering contexts. If a material has high 'tensility,' it means it can be stretched a lot without breaking. This word is not commonly used in everyday conversation; it's more likely to appear in textbooks or technical reports about materials science.","example_sentences":[]},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The high **tensility** of carbon fiber makes it ideal for use in aerospace applications.","translation":"炭素繊維の高い引張性は、航空宇宙用途に最適です。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"引張性"},{"sentence":"Testing the **tensility** of different polymers is crucial for selecting the right material for packaging.","translation":"さまざまなポリマーの引張性を試験することは、包装に適切な材料を選択するために重要です。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"引張性"}]}

The connection to 'odyssesthai' is somewhat ironic, as the feeling is more about missing the journey than hating it.

It describes a specific type of homesickness - the kind you feel not because you dislike where you are, but because you miss a particularly wonderful trip or experience you've had. It's the bittersweet feeling of longing for a past adventure. Because it's a neologism, it's not found in most dictionaries and may not be understood by everyone.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ I have odylism for my old house.","correct":"✓ I have odylism after my trip to Italy.","note":"Odylism is specifically related to missing a journey, not a place of residence.

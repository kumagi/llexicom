It's often used in discussions about economics, politics, and social issues. Because it's not a commonly used word, it's important to understand its meaning in context. It is derived from the word 'pauper,' which refers to a very poor person, and the suffix '-ize,' which indicates a process or action. Therefore, 'pauperizing' means 'to make into a pauper' or 'to make poor.'"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The government's austerity measures are pauperizing vulnerable populations.","translation":"政府の緊縮財政政策は脆弱な人々を貧困化させている。","type":"verb (present participle)","meaning_category":"making poor"},{"sentence":"Globalization, if not managed carefully, can have a pauperizing effect on developing nations.","translation":"グローバル化は、注意深く管理されない場合、発展途上国に貧困化の影響を与える可能性がある。","type":"verb (present participle)","meaning_category":"causing poverty"}]}

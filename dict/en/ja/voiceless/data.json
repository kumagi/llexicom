It can mean literally not having a voice, like if someone is unable to speak. It's also used in linguistics to describe sounds made without vibrating your vocal cords, such as the 's' in 'cats'. Finally, it can mean not having the power to express your opinions or influence decisions, like when we talk about giving a voice to the voiceless in society. Because it has these different meanings, it's important to understand the context to know what 'voiceless' means in each situation."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The singer was temporarily voiceless due to a throat infection.","translation":"その歌手は喉の感染症のため一時的に声が出なかった。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"unable to speak"},{"sentence":"The 'f' in 'fish' is a voiceless sound.","translation":"「fish」の「f」は無声音です。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"phonetics"},{"sentence":"We must advocate for the voiceless and marginalized communities.","translation":"私たちは、発言権のない、社会から疎外されたコミュニティのために提唱しなければなりません。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"powerless"}]}

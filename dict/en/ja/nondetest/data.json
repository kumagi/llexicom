It refers to tests whose outcome may vary between runs, even with identical inputs, due to the inherent non-deterministic nature of the system being tested. Understanding this term requires familiarity with concepts like concurrency, determinism, and software testing methodologies."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"Analyzing the results of a nondetest requires careful consideration of potential race conditions.","translation":"非決定性テストの結果を分析するには、潜在的な競合状態を慎重に検討する必要があります。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"computing"},{"sentence":"The team developed a suite of nondetests to evaluate the robustness of the distributed database.","translation":"チームは、分散データベースの堅牢性を評価するために、一連の非決定性テストを開発しました。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"computing"}]}

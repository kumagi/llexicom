It refers to a specific type of sterol found predominantly in the feces of herbivores, particularly horses. Its primary use is as a marker for identifying and tracing fecal contamination in environmental samples. Due to its specialized nature, the term is rarely encountered outside of scientific contexts. Understanding requires a background in chemistry and environmental science.

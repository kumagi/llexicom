While 'international' describes something *between* nations, 'internationale' often carries a connotation of collaboration, solidarity, and shared principles *among* them. Historically, it was strongly associated with socialist and communist movements promoting worker unity across borders.  Today, it can still be used in that context but is also applied more broadly to describe things like international organizations or agreements."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The **Internationale** Workingmen's Association was a 19th-century organization aiming to unite workers globally.","translation":"国際労働者協会は、世界中の労働者を団結させることを目的とした19世紀の組織でした。","type":"historical context","meaning_category":"socialist/communist movement"},{"sentence":"The conference brought together representatives from various **internationale** bodies.","translation":"会議には、さまざまな国際機関の代表者が集まりました。","type":"general context","meaning_category":"international organizations"},{"sentence":"He was a staunch supporter of the **Internationale**, believing in proletarian solidarity.","translation":"彼はインターナショナルを強く支持し、プロレタリアートの連帯を信じていました。","type":"political context","meaning_category":"political ideology"},{"sentence":"The **internationale** community condemned the act of aggression.","translation":"国際社会は侵略行為を非難しました。","type":"general context","meaning_category":"international cooperation"}]}

The idea is that a 'scrupulus' in one's shoe would cause discomfort and hesitation, much like a moral qualm.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/ˌskruːpjʊˈlɒsɪtiz/","syllables":"scru-pu-lo-si-ties"},"inflection":{"noun_plural":"scrupulosities"},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Scrupulosities' refers primarily to an excessive and often debilitating concern with one's own conscience and moral correctness.

Your brain cells communicate via electrical impulses and are active all the time, even when you're asleep. This activity shows up as wavy lines on an EEG recording. An EEG is one of the main diagnostic tests for epilepsy. An EEG can also play a role in diagnosing other brain disorders.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ electroencephalogram are important.","correct":"✓ electroencephalograms are important.","note":"Electroencephalogram is a countable noun, so use the plural form when referring to multiple instances."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["electroencephalograph (noun: 脳波計)","electroencephalography (noun: 脳波検査法)"],"phrasal_verbs":[]},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"The word \"electroencephalogram\" refers to a test that measures the electrical activity in the brain.

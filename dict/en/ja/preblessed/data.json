It is often used in religious or spiritual contexts to describe objects or substances that have already been consecrated or sanctified. Because it is not a commonly used word, understanding the meaning of the prefix 'pre-' and the base word 'blessed' is helpful in deciphering its meaning. The word is more likely to be encountered in specialized texts or discussions related to religion or spirituality."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The priest used the preblessed incense during the service.","translation":"司祭は礼拝中に、以前に祝福された香を使った。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"already blessed"},{"sentence":"The preblessed ground was considered sacred.","translation":"その以前に祝福された土地は神聖だと考えられていた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"previously consecrated"}]}

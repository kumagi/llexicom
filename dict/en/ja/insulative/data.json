It's closely related to the words 'insulate' (the verb, meaning to protect from heat, cold, noise, etc.) and 'insulation' (the noun, referring to the material used for this purpose). You'll often find it in discussions about building materials, electrical safety, or energy efficiency. It's important to remember that 'insulative' is an adjective, so it needs to modify a noun (e.g., 'insulative properties')."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The new windows are more **insulative** than the old ones.","translation":"新しい窓は古い窓よりも断熱性が高い。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"断熱性のある"},{"sentence":"The **insulative** coating protects the wires from short circuits.","translation":"絶縁コーティングは電線を短絡から保護する。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"絶縁性のある"},{"sentence":"The thick walls provide an **insulative** effect against the cold.","translation":"厚い壁は寒さに対する断熱効果をもたらす。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"断熱性のある"},{"sentence":"The company aims to create an **insulative** environment for its employees, free from distractions.","translation":"その会社は、従業員にとって気が散るもののない保護的な環境を作ることを目指している。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"保護的な"}]}

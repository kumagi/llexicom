'Neurodiversity' refers to the natural variation in human brain function and behavioral traits. 'Affirming' means to validate and support. Therefore, 'neurodiversity-affirming' describes approaches, practices, or environments that recognize, respect, and support neurodiversity.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":null,"syllables":"neu-ro-di-ver-si-ty-af-firm-ing"},"inflection":{"notes":"This is an adjective and does not have typical inflectional forms."},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Neurodiversity-affirming' is a relatively new term that is increasingly used in fields such as education, therapy, and employment.

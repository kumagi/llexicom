Quantiles are cut points dividing the range of a probability distribution into contiguous intervals with equal probabilities, or dividing the observations in a sample in the same way. Thus, quartiles are the values that divide a list of numbers into quarters: The first quartile (Q1) is defined as the middle number between the smallest number and the median of the data set.

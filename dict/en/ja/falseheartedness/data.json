'False' comes from Old English 'fals', meaning deceptive or untrue. 'Hearted' refers to the heart as the seat of emotions and loyalty. Thus, 'falsehearted' means having a false or disloyal heart. Adding the suffix '-ness' turns the adjective into a noun, indicating the state or quality of being falsehearted.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/ˌfɔːlsˈhɑːrtɪdnəs/","syllables":"false-heart-ed-ness"},"inflection":{"noun_plural":"falseheartednesses (rarely used)"},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Falseheartedness' is a relatively formal and uncommon word.

It suggests someone is intentionally deceitful and cannot be trusted. Because it is a less common word, it is more likely to be found in formal writing or literature where the author wants to emphasize the gravity of someone's betrayal or insincerity. It is not a word typically used in everyday conversation.

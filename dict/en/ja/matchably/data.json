It suggests a degree of similarity, harmony, or equivalence. The word is not as commonly used as its related forms like 'match,' 'matching,' or 'matchable,' but it serves to express the quality of being able to be matched in a particular way. It is often used in contexts where coordination, compatibility, or comparability are important.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The two items matched matchably.","correct":"✓ The two items matched well. / ✓ The two items were matchable.","note":"Using 'matched matchably' is redundant.

It's not a very common word, so it's more likely to be encountered in technical or formal writing where precise description of compatibility or comparability is needed. It is formed by adding '-ably' to the adjective 'matchable,' which itself is derived from the verb 'match.' Because of its relative rarity and the more common usage of related words like 'compatibly' or 'harmoniously,' 'matchably' is best suited for advanced English learners who need a nuanced vocabulary for specific contexts."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The replacement part fit matchably with the original, ensuring proper function.","translation":"交換部品はオリジナルと適合するように適合し、適切な機能を保証しました。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"適合するように"},{"sentence":"The two theories explain the phenomenon matchably, although from different perspectives.","translation":"2つの理論は異なる視点からではあるが、その現象を匹敵するように説明しています。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"匹敵するように"},{"sentence":"The new system was designed to integrate matchably with the existing infrastructure.","translation":"新しいシステムは、既存のインフラストラクチャと適合するように統合するように設計されました。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"調和するように"}]}

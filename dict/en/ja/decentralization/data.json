It can apply to government, organizations, and systems. In government, it involves transferring power to local authorities. In organizations, it means giving more autonomy to departments or branches. In technology, particularly with blockchain, it refers to distributing control across a network rather than having a single point of control.

This can happen in government, where local areas get more control, or in technology, like with blockchain, where no single person controls the system. It's the opposite of 'centralization,' where everything is controlled from one place.

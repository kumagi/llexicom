It's a fundamental concept in mathematics, particularly in algebra and geometry. When you see an ordered pair like (3, 5), the '3' is the x-coordinate, telling you how far to move along the horizontal axis from the origin (the point where the axes cross). The x-coordinate is also known as the abscissa. It's important to understand this concept for graphing equations and understanding spatial relationships.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The point (2, 3) has an x-coordinate of 2.","translation":"点(2, 3)のx座標は2です。","type":"definition","meaning_category":"x座標"},{"sentence":"To find where the line crosses the x-axis, set y to zero and solve for the x-coordinate.","translation":"線がx軸と交差する場所を見つけるには、yをゼロに設定し、x座標について解きます。","type":"application","meaning_category":"x座標"},{"sentence":"In computer graphics, the x-coordinate often represents the horizontal position of a pixel on the screen.","translation":"コンピュータグラフィックスでは、x座標は多くの場合、画面上のピクセルの水平方向の位置を表します。","type":"application","meaning_category":"x座標"}]}

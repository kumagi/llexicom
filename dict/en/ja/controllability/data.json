It's often used when talking about machines, systems, or even situations where you want to be able to direct what happens. For example, if a car has good \"controllability,\" it means it's easy to steer and keep on the road. The word is formed by adding \"-ability\" to \"controllable,\" which means \"able to be controlled.\" It's a useful word when you need to talk about how well something responds to being managed or directed."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The pilot praised the aircraft's excellent **controllability** during the emergency landing.","translation":"パイロットは、緊急着陸時の航空機の優れた制御可能性を称賛した。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"操縦性"},{"sentence":"Researchers are working to improve the **controllability** of prosthetic limbs.","translation":"研究者たちは、義肢の制御可能性を改善するために取り組んでいる。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"制御可能性"},{"sentence":"The **controllability** of the experimental drug's side effects is still under investigation.","translation":"実験薬の副作用の制御可能性は、まだ調査中である。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"制御可能性"},{"sentence":"The project manager emphasized the importance of maintaining **controllability** over the budget.","translation":"プロジェクトマネージャーは、予算に対する制御可能性を維持することの重要性を強調した。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"制御可能性"}]}

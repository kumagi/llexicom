It quantifies how much radiation (usually light) is reflected by a surface. It can be expressed as a percentage or a ratio. The related term 'reflectivity' is often used interchangeably, but 'reflectance' usually refers to a specific measurement under defined conditions, while 'reflectivity' is a more general material property.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"The reflectance is high, so the object absorbs a lot of light.","correct":"The reflectance is high, so the object reflects a lot of light.","note":"High reflectance means that the object reflects, not absorbs, light."},{"incorrect":"Reflectance is the same as refraction.","correct":"Reflectance is the reflection of light, while refraction is the bending of light as it passes through a medium.","note":"Reflectance and refraction are distinct phenomena.

It's often used in science and engineering when talking about materials, colors, and how objects interact with light. If something has high reflectance, it means it reflects a lot of light. If it has low reflectance, it means it doesn't reflect much light, and instead absorbs or transmits it. You'll often see this word used in discussions about solar panels, paints, and remote sensing.","priority":"★★★"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The **reflectance** of the snow-covered ground is very high.","translation":"雪に覆われた地面の反射率は非常に高い。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"reflection ratio"},{"sentence":"The satellite measures the **reflectance** of different land surfaces.","translation":"衛星は、異なる地表面の反射率を測定する。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"reflection ratio"},{"sentence":"The **reflectance** properties of the coating make it ideal for use in optical instruments.","translation":"そのコーティングの反射特性は、光学機器での使用に最適である。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"reflection properties"},{"sentence":"Changes in **reflectance** can indicate changes in vegetation health.","translation":"反射率の変化は、植生の健全性の変化を示す可能性がある。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"reflection ratio"}]}

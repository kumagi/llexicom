Sponges have internal skeletons made of small needle-like structures called spicules. When a sponge's skeleton is composed of spicules that each have a single point or axis, it is described as 'unispiculate'. This characteristic is important for classifying and identifying different sponge species.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{},"related_words":{"derivatives":["spicule","spicular","multispiculate"],"related_terms":["sponge","Porifera","skeleton"],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"N/A","frequency_google_ngram":"Very low frequency","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C2","text":"The term 'unispiculate' is a technical term used in the field of zoology, specifically when describing the skeletal structure of sponges.

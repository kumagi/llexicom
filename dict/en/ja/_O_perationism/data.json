It says that to understand a scientific idea, you need to know the exact steps (operations) used to measure or define it. For example, if you want to understand 'length,' operationism says you need to know how to measure it with a ruler. This idea was made popular by a scientist named Bridgman. Some people like operationism because it makes science clear, but others don't because it can create too many different meanings for the same idea."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The psychologist used operationism to define intelligence based on test scores.","translation":"心理学者は、テストのスコアに基づいて知能を定義するために操作主義を使用した。","type":"example","meaning_category":"definition"},{"sentence":"Operationism requires that every scientific concept be tied to a specific, measurable operation.","translation":"操作主義では、すべての科学的概念が特定の、測定可能な操作に関連付けられる必要がある。","type":"example","meaning_category":"requirement"}]}

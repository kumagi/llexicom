It primarily refers to the action of removing tacks (small, sharp nails) or, in a more specialized context, removing the tack (equipment) from a horse. Understanding requires familiarity with the word 'tack' and the prefix 'un-' indicating the reversal of an action. Due to its limited usage, it's more likely to be encountered in specific contexts related to crafts, notice boards, or equestrian activities."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"She carefully **untacked** the old photographs from the scrapbook.","translation":"彼女は丁寧にスクラップブックから古い写真を剥がした。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"removing tacks"},{"sentence":"The rider **untacked** the weary horse after the long competition.","translation":"騎手は長い競技の後、疲れた馬から馬具を外した。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"removing horse equipment"}]}

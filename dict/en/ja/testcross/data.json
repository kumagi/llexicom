It refers to a specific type of cross performed to determine the genotype of an individual showing a dominant trait. This involves crossing the individual with a homozygous recessive individual and analyzing the phenotypes of the offspring to infer the genotype of the parent. Understanding this term requires a solid foundation in basic genetics principles, including concepts like dominance, recessiveness, homozygosity, heterozygosity, and Mendelian inheritance.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"A testcross can reveal whether a tall pea plant with unknown genotype is homozygous (TT) or heterozygous (Tt).","translation":"検定交雑は、遺伝子型が不明な背の高いエンドウ植物がホモ接合体（TT）であるかヘテロ接合体（Tt）であるかを明らかにすることができます。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"genetics"},{"sentence":"To confirm the genotype of the transgenic mice, we will testcross them with wild-type mice.","translation":"トランスジェニックマウスの遺伝子型を確認するために、野生型マウスと検定交雑します。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"genetics"}]}

It refers to fats that have been treated or coated to prevent their digestion in the rumen, the first chamber of the animal's stomach. This protection allows the fat to pass through the rumen and be digested further down the digestive tract, increasing the animal's energy intake. Understanding this term requires knowledge of ruminant digestion and animal nutrition principles."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The dairy farmer added a fat-protected supplement to the cows' diet.","translation":"その酪農家は、乳牛の飼料に脂肪保護サプリメントを添加しました。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"栄養学"},{"sentence":"Fat-protected fats are designed to bypass the rumen and be absorbed in the small intestine.","translation":"脂肪保護された脂肪は、ルーメンをバイパスして小腸で吸収されるように設計されています。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"栄養学"}]}

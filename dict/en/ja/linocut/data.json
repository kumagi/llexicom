It involves carving an image into a sheet of linoleum—a material often used for flooring—using specialized tools like gouges and knives. The areas that are *not* carved away retain ink and are pressed onto paper to create the print. Unlike woodcut which uses harder wood, linoleum is softer and easier to carve making it popular among artists for its accessibility and distinctive qualities. Linocuts often have a bold, graphic style due to the material’s properties."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"She specialized in **linocut** prints depicting scenes from nature.","translation":"彼女は自然の風景を描いたリノカット版画を専門としていました。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"リノカット作品"},{"sentence":"The artist demonstrated the **linocut** process to her students.","translation":"アーティストは学生たちにリノカットの工程を実演しました。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"リノカット技法"},{"sentence":"He created a series of striking **linocuts** for the book's illustrations.","translation":"彼は本の挿絵のために印象的な一連のリノカット版画を制作しました。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"リノカット作品群"}]}

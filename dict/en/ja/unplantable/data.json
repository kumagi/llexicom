This is often due to poor soil quality or other environmental factors. The word is formed by adding the prefix 'un-' to 'plantable', which means able to be planted. Because it is more technical and specific, it is less frequently used in everyday conversation. Understanding the root word 'plant' and the negative prefix 'un-' is helpful in understanding its meaning.

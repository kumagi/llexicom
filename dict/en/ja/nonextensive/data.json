For example, mass and volume are extensive.  A nonextensive property does not have this additive property.  Nonextensive statistical mechanics is used to describe systems with long-range interactions, long-term memories, or fractal structures, where the usual assumptions of Boltzmann-Gibbs statistics do not hold.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[],"priority":"☆☆☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["extensivity (名詞: 示量性)","extensively (副詞: 広範囲に)"],"priority":"★★★"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency","priority":"☆☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C2","text":"'Nonextensive' is a technical term primarily used in physics, thermodynamics, and related fields.

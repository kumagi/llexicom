It's not used very often in everyday conversation. You're more likely to encounter phrases like \"lack of opportunity\" or \"bad timing\" instead. Because it's rare, it's generally used in more formal writing or speech when you want to emphasize the unfortunate nature of the timing or the absence of a chance.

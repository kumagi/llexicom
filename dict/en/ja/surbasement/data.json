The prefix 'sur-' is somewhat unusual in this context, as it typically indicates something being on top of or exceeding something else, whereas a surbasement is below. This might imply it's a 'super' or 'main' basement.","priority":"N/A"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/sɜːrˈbeɪsmənt/","syllables":"sur-base-ment"},"inflection":{"noun_plural":"surbasements"},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"The term 'surbasement' is not as common as 'basement' or 'cellar'. It generally refers to a basement, which is a room or set of rooms below the main level of a building. The 'sur-' prefix doesn't have a clear logical function here, and the term may be used to emphasize the size or importance of the basement.","priority":"N/A"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ I live on the surbasement of the building.","correct":"✓ I live in the surbasement of the building.","note":"Use 'in' to indicate location within the surbasement."}],"priority":"N/A"},"related_words":{"derivatives":[],"phrasal_verbs":[],"related_terms":["basement","cellar","sublevel","foundation"]},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"N/A","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency","priority":"N/A"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"The word 'surbasement' is relatively uncommon and may not be familiar to all English speakers. It is essentially a synonym for 'basement', referring to a room or space below the ground level of a building. Understanding the meaning requires knowledge of the prefix 'sur-', which usually indicates something 'above' or 'beyond', but in this case, its use is less straightforward and might imply a 'main' or 'significant' basement."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The old house had a dark and mysterious surbasement.","translation":"その古い家には、暗くて神秘的な地下室があった。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"Basement"},{"sentence":"They converted the surbasement into a home theater.","translation":"彼らは地下室をホームシアターに改造した。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"Basement"}]}

It refers to the process of restoring an emulsion that has separated. An emulsion is a mixture of two or more liquids that are normally immiscible (unmixable or unblendable). When an emulsion breaks, the liquids separate, and re-emulsifying involves mixing them again to create a stable mixture. This often requires mechanical action or the addition of an emulsifier to keep the liquids dispersed. Understanding this term requires familiarity with basic chemistry and cooking principles."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The vinaigrette separated, so I had to vigorously whisk it to re-emulsify the dressing.","translation":"ドレッシングが分離したので、激しくかき混ぜて再乳化する必要がありました。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"再乳化する"},{"sentence":"If your hollandaise sauce breaks, try adding a drop of cold water and whisking rapidly to re-emulsify it.","translation":"オランデーズソースが分離した場合は、冷水を一滴加えて素早くかき混ぜて再乳化してみてください。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"再乳化する"}]}

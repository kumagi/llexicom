Its meaning is easily understood through its components: 'never' (not at any time), 'diet' (restricting food intake for weight loss), and '-tree' (used to create a noun referring to a person with a certain characteristic, like 'carefree'). The term is used humorously to describe someone who seems to be naturally thin and never needs to diet. Understanding the word requires a good grasp of English word formation and an understanding of common cultural attitudes towards dieting and body image."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"My friend is such a never-dietree; she can eat pizza every day and still stay slim.","translation":"私の友達は本当にダイエット不要な人だ。毎日ピザを食べてもスリムなままだ。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"person who doesn't need to diet"},{"sentence":"I dream of one day becoming a never-dietree, but I think it's just wishful thinking.","translation":"いつかダイエット不要な人になることを夢見ているけど、ただの願望だと思う。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"person who doesn't need to diet"}]}

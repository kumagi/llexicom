This term is most often used in scientific and engineering contexts, such as when discussing distillation processes, thermodynamics, or atmospheric phenomena. It implies a cycle of phase changes where a substance transitions from a condensed state to a gaseous state and then back to a condensed state. Understanding this term requires familiarity with basic concepts of phase transitions and thermodynamics."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The efficiency of the distillation column was reduced due to the recondensation of the volatile compounds.","translation":"揮発性化合物の再凝縮により、蒸留塔の効率が低下した。","type":"scientific/technical","meaning_category":"再凝縮 (technical context)"},{"sentence":"In cloud formation, recondensation plays a crucial role in the growth of water droplets.","translation":"雲の形成において、再凝縮は水滴の成長に重要な役割を果たす。","type":"meteorological","meaning_category":"再凝縮 (meteorology)"}]}

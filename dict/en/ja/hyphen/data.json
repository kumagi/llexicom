It's shorter than a dash. Hyphens are commonly used to create compound adjectives (e.g., 'well-known author'), clarify meaning (e.g., 're-cover' vs. 'recover'), and sometimes to split longer words across lines.  They’re important for readability and avoiding ambiguity in written text, but overuse can make writing look cluttered."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"Please add a **hyphen** between 'well' and 'being' when you write 'well-being'.","translation":"「well」と「being」の間にハイフンを入れて「well-being」と書いてください。","type":"noun (punctuation mark)","meaning_category":"名詞としての用法・指示"},{"sentence":"Use a **hyphen** to connect the prefix 'ex-' with 'president'.","translation":"'ex-'という接頭辞と'president'を接続するときはハイフンを使ってください。","type":"noun (punctuation mark)","meaning_category":"名詞としての用法・指示"},{"sentence":"The word is often **hyphenated** when used as an adjective before a noun.","translation":"その単語は、名詞の前に形容詞として使われる場合によくハイフンでつなげられます。","type":"verb (past participle)","meaning_category":"動詞としての用法"},{"sentence":"She carefully **hyphenated** the long compound word to make it easier to read.","translation":"彼女は長い複合語を読みやすくするために注意深くハイフンでつなげました。","type":"verb (past tense)","meaning_category":"動詞としての用法"}]}

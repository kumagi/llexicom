The reaction typically requires a catalyst, often a transition metal complex. The resulting aldehydes are versatile intermediates used in the production of alcohols, carboxylic acids, and other chemicals. The regioselectivity (ratio of linear to branched aldehydes) and enantioselectivity (for chiral alkenes) are important considerations in hydroformylation reactions.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Hydroformilation is a process.","correct":"✓ Hydroformylation is a process.","note":"Common misspelling.

It implies a state of development that is beyond the most basic or original form, but not yet fully advanced or modern. It can be used to describe cultures, societies, technologies, or even ideas. The term can sometimes carry a negative connotation, suggesting a lack of sophistication or progress, so it should be used carefully and with sensitivity.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The semiprimitive technology was very efficient.","correct":"✓ The rudimentary technology was very efficient.","note":"If the technology is efficient, 'rudimentary' might be a better word choice than 'semiprimitive' as 'semiprimitive' can imply inefficiency or underdevelopment."},{"incorrect":"✗ The semiprimitive city was very modern.","correct":"✓ The partially developed city was becoming modern.","note":"'Semiprimitive' and 'modern' are contradictory.

It's often used in anthropological or historical contexts to describe societies or cultures that have some, but not all, of the characteristics of a primitive state. The prefix 'semi-' indicates that it is only partially so, implying a state somewhere between primitive and fully developed. Because of its potential to be seen as pejorative or insensitive, it should be used with care and a clear understanding of its implications."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The remote island's culture was described as semiprimitive, blending ancient traditions with modern influences.","translation":"その遠隔地の島の文化は、古代の伝統と現代の影響が混ざり合っているため、半原始的であると説明された。","type":"general","meaning_category":"general"},{"sentence":"Their semiprimitive tools were surprisingly effective for hunting and gathering.","translation":"彼らの半原始的な道具は、狩猟や採集に驚くほど効果的だった。","type":"general","meaning_category":"general"}]}

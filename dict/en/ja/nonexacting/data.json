It is used to describe things that don't require a lot of effort, skill, or precision. For example, a \"nonexacting job\" would be an easy job that doesn't require a lot of training or experience. It's the opposite of \"exacting,\" which means demanding or strict. Because it is a less common word, it is more likely to be encountered in formal writing or speech. Understanding the prefix \"non-\" (meaning \"not\") and the root word \"exacting\" can help in deciphering its meaning."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The grading system in the course was surprisingly **nonexacting**.","translation":"そのコースの採点システムは驚くほど寛容だった。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"寛容な"},{"sentence":"He preferred a **nonexacting** role in the company, avoiding high-pressure situations.","translation":"彼は会社でプレッシャーの高い状況を避け、要求水準の高くない役割を好んだ。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"要求水準が高くない"},{"sentence":"The **nonexacting** nature of the task made it suitable for beginners.","translation":"その仕事の要求水準が高くない性質は、初心者に適していた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"要求水準が高くない"}]}

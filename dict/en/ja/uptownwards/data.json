It's mostly used in American English, especially when talking about New York City, where 'uptown' refers to the northern part of Manhattan. You'll usually see it used to describe movement or direction, like 'The train was heading uptownwards'. Because it's not a very common word, it's important to make sure your audience understands what you mean when you use it."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The taxi drove uptownwards, passing Central Park on its left.","translation":"タクシーはアップタウン方面へ走り、左手にセントラルパークを通り過ぎた。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"アップタウンへ向かって"},{"sentence":"The uptownwards traffic was heavy due to the evening rush hour.","translation":"夕方のラッシュアワーのため、アップタウン方面へ向かう交通は混雑していた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"アップタウンへ向かう"}]}

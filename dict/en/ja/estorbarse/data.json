It's used when the subject of the sentence is both performing and receiving the action. The reflexive pronoun (me, te, se, nos, os, se) is essential for the correct usage of this verb. It is more nuanced than the simple verb 'estorbar', which means to hinder or obstruct something else. The reflexive form implies a reciprocal or self-affecting action."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"Si te estorbo, dímelo.","translation":"If I'm in your way, tell me.","type":"general","meaning_category":"being in the way"},{"sentence":"No quiero estorbarme en tus planes.","translation":"I don't want to interfere with your plans.","type":"general","meaning_category":"interfering"},{"sentence":"Me estorbo con mis propios pensamientos.","translation":"I get in my own way with my own thoughts.","type":"general","meaning_category":"hindering oneself"}]}

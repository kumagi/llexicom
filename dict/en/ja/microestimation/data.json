It involves breaking down a project into its smallest possible components and then estimating the time, cost, or resources needed for each component. The individual estimates are then aggregated to create an overall project estimate. This method is often used when a high degree of accuracy is required or when the project is complex and has many dependencies.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ We used microestimation for the entire project at the beginning.","correct":"✓ We used microestimation for the critical path tasks at the beginning.","note":"Microestimation can be too time-consuming for all tasks.

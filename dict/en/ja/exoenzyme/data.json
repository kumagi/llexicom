It refers to enzymes that are secreted by cells (usually microorganisms) to break down large molecules outside the cell. These enzymes are essential for nutrient acquisition, as they degrade complex substrates into smaller, absorbable units. Understanding exoenzymes requires a background in basic biology and chemistry. The term is rarely encountered outside of scientific contexts.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The fungus secreted exoenzymes to digest the cellulose in the wood.","translation":"その菌類は木材中のセルロースを消化するために細胞外酵素を分泌した。","type":"general","meaning_category":"分解"},{"sentence":"Exoenzyme production is a key factor in the virulence of some pathogenic bacteria.","translation":"細胞外酵素の産生は、一部の病原性細菌の病原性の重要な要素である。","type":"specific","meaning_category":"病原性"},{"sentence":"Researchers are studying exoenzymes for their potential use in industrial processes.","translation":"研究者たちは、産業プロセスにおける潜在的な利用のために細胞外酵素を研究している。","type":"research","meaning_category":"産業利用"}]}

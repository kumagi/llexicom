The word is formed by adding the prefix \"un-\" to \"weeping,\" which is the present participle of the verb \"weep\" (to cry). Because it is not a common word, it is more likely to be encountered in literature or formal writing than in everyday conversation."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"Despite the tragedy, she remained unweeping and composed.","translation":"その悲劇にもかかわらず、彼女は涙を見せず、冷静さを保った。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"涙を流さない"},{"sentence":"The unweeping mourners stood in silent respect.","translation":"涙を流さない参列者たちは、静かに敬意を表して立っていた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"悲しんでいない"}]}

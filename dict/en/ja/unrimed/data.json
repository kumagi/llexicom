Because it is a more specialized term, it is likely to be encountered by advanced learners or those with a specific interest in poetry. It is formed by adding the prefix \"un-\" to \"rimed,\" which means \"having rhyme.\" Therefore, \"unrimed\" simply means \"not having rhyme.\" The word is not commonly used in everyday conversation."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"Shakespeare sometimes used unrimed iambic pentameter.","translation":"シェイクスピアは時々、無韻の弱強五歩格を使用した。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"無韻の"},{"sentence":"The play featured both rimed and unrimed passages.","translation":"その劇には、韻を踏んだ箇所と韻を踏んでいない箇所の両方があった。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"無韻の"},{"sentence":"Many modern poems are unrimed.","translation":"現代詩の多くは無韻である。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"無韻の"}]}

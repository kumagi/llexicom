Native speakers almost always opt for \"helpfully\" or rephrase the sentence to use \"in a helpful way\" or a similar construction. Its infrequent usage makes it sound somewhat archaic or overly formal. While understanding its meaning is straightforward, actively using it is generally discouraged in favor of more common alternatives."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"She responded helpingly to my request for information.","translation":"彼女は私の情報提供の依頼に親切に応えてくれた。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"親切に (まれ)"},{"sentence":"He spoke helpingly about the new policy.","translation":"彼は新しい政策について助けになるように話した。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"助けになるように (まれ)"}]}

It refers to a state where a specific gene's expression is suppressed or completely prevented. This can occur naturally or be induced experimentally using techniques like RNA interference (RNAi) or CRISPR. The term is often used to describe cells, organisms, or experimental models where a particular gene has been silenced to study its function or the effects of its absence.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The gene was silenced, so it's expressing now.","correct":"✓ The gene was silenced, so it's *not* expressing now.","note":"Gene silencing prevents expression, so the gene should not be expressing."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["gene silencing (noun)","silencing (noun)"],"phrasal_verbs":[],"priority":"★★★"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency - Primarily used in scientific literature.","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Gene-silenced' is a term used in science, especially in biology and genetics. It means that a gene, which normally tells a cell to make a certain protein, has been switched off or made inactive.

It is often used in engineering, computer science, and education. Understanding the term requires familiarity with the concept of 'input' as data or signals fed into a system, and 'control' as the mechanism that governs its behavior. The term is relatively uncommon in everyday language. In an educational context, it refers to a teaching approach where the teacher carefully selects and manages the input students receive."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The factory's production line is entirely input-controlled, with each step triggered by the completion of the previous one.","translation":"工場の生産ラインは完全に入力制御されており、各ステップは前のステップの完了によってトリガーされます。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"Technical system"},{"sentence":"The teacher used an input-controlled activity to introduce new vocabulary.","translation":"先生は新しい語彙を紹介するために、インプット統制された活動を使用しました。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"Educational methodology"}]}

It specifically refers to the process by which a glacier or river erodes a valley or channel to a depth greater than its original or equilibrium depth. This often results in distinctive landforms such as U-shaped valleys (in the case of glaciers) or hanging valleys. The term implies an imbalance in the erosional processes, where the rate of erosion exceeds the rate of deposition or other factors that would normally limit the depth of the valley or channel.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The construction crew overdeepened the foundation for the building.","correct":"✓ The construction crew deepened the foundation for the building.","note":"'Overdeepen' is typically used in the context of natural processes like glacial or fluvial erosion, not in the context of construction or excavation.

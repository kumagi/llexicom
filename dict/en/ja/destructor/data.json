It's automatically invoked when an object is no longer needed, ensuring that allocated memory is freed and resources like file handles or network connections are released. In languages like C++, destructors are explicitly defined, while in languages like Java, garbage collection handles memory management, but finalizers can serve a similar purpose.

In computer science, it refers to a special method that automatically executes when an object is destroyed, freeing up resources. Outside of programming, it can metaphorically describe something that causes destruction or ruin. The programming context is more technical and requires familiarity with object-oriented programming concepts. The figurative usage is less common but understandable with a general vocabulary.

They are formed by the intramolecular esterification of a hydroxy acid, where a hydroxyl group (-OH) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) within the same molecule react to form an ester linkage and a cyclic structure. The size of the lactone ring is indicated by Greek prefixes (beta-, gamma-, delta-, etc.) corresponding to the number of carbon atoms in the ring.

This means they have an ester functional group (a carbon atom double-bonded to one oxygen and single-bonded to another oxygen, which is also bonded to another carbon) within a ring structure. They are created when a molecule that contains both a hydroxyl group (-OH) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) reacts with itself to form a ring. The term is mainly used in chemistry and related scientific fields, so it is not a common word for everyday use. Understanding it requires some knowledge of organic chemistry nomenclature and functional groups."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The synthesis of various macrolactones has been extensively studied due to their biological activities.","translation":"様々なマクロラクトンの合成は、それらの生物活性のために広く研究されてきました。","type":"technical","meaning_category":"organic chemistry"},{"sentence":"Gamma-lactones are often used as flavorings and fragrances in the food and cosmetic industries.","translation":"ガンマ-ラクトンは、食品および化粧品業界で香料および香料としてよく使用されます。","type":"application","meaning_category":"industrial chemistry"}]}

Their primary function is to synthesize and store starch, which is a polymer of glucose. Amyloplasts are particularly abundant in storage organs such as roots, tubers, and seeds. They also play a role in gravitropism, the process by which plants sense and respond to gravity. In root cap cells, amyloplasts settle at the bottom of the cell, providing a signal that helps the root grow in the direction of gravity.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Amyloplasts are found in animal cells.","correct":"✓ Amyloplasts are found in plant cells.","note":"Amyloplasts are specific to plant cells and are not found in animal cells."},{"incorrect":"✗ Amyloplasts are responsible for photosynthesis.","correct":"✓ Chloroplasts are responsible for photosynthesis. / ✓ Amyloplasts are responsible for starch storage.","note":"Photosynthesis is the function of chloroplasts, while amyloplasts store starch."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["amyloplastic (adjective)"],"phrasal_verbs":[],"related_terms":["plastid","leucoplast","chloroplast","starch","granule","gravitropism","organelle","plant cell","root cap"],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"The term 'amyloplast' is a specialized term in plant biology, specifically referring to an organelle within plant cells responsible for starch synthesis and storage.

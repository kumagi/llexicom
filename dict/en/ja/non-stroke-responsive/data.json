It's a complex term because it combines 'non-' (meaning 'not'), 'stroke' (referring to a cerebrovascular accident), and 'responsive' (meaning showing improvement or reaction). This term is usually found in medical reports, research papers, or discussions among healthcare professionals. It indicates that standard treatments or rehabilitation efforts may not be effective in the affected area or for the specific patient.

These sounds are produced by forcing air through a narrow channel in the vocal tract, creating turbulence that results in a distinctive hissing noise. In English, the most common sibilants are /s/, /z/, /ʃ/ (as in 'ship'), and /ʒ/ (as in 'measure'). The proper articulation of sibilants is crucial for clear and accurate pronunciation, and difficulties with these sounds can sometimes lead to speech impediments or miscommunication.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ He has trouble with sibilant.","correct":"✓ He has trouble with sibilants.","note":"'Sibilants' is typically used in the plural form because it refers to a category of sounds, not just a single sound."},{"incorrect":"✗ Sibilant sounds are easy to pronounce.","correct":"✓ Sibilant sounds can be challenging to pronounce (for some people).","note":"While some speakers may find sibilants easy to pronounce, they can be particularly challenging for non-native speakers or individuals with certain speech impediments."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["sibilant (adjective: 歯擦音の; noun: 歯擦音)","sibilance (noun: 歯擦音性)"],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"level":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"The word 'sibilants' refers to a specific category of consonant sounds characterized by a hissing quality.

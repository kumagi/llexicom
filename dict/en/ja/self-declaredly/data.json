It often implies that the claim might not be true or widely accepted. It's a more complex word, so it's not commonly used in everyday conversation. You'll usually find it in more formal writing or speech when someone wants to show doubt about a person's claim. For example, if someone says, \"He is self-declaredly a genius,\" it means he claims to be a genius, but others may not agree."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The self-declaredly independent nation struggled to gain international recognition.","translation":"その自称独立国は、国際的な承認を得るのに苦労した。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"自称して"},{"sentence":"She self-declaredly had no prior experience in the field, which made her job application surprising.","translation":"彼女は自らその分野での経験がないと宣言しており、それが彼女の仕事への応募を驚くべきものにした。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"自ら宣言して"}]}

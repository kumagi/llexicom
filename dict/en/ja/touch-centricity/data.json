It is often used in the context of user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) design for devices like smartphones, tablets, and touch-screen computers. The term implies that the design is optimized for touch input, and other input methods (like keyboard and mouse) may be secondary or less emphasized. The term can sometimes carry a slightly negative connotation if the touch-centric design makes the interface less usable with non-touch input methods.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The touch-centricity is very important for the web design.","correct":"✓ Touch-centricity is very important for web design.","note":"'Touch-centricity' is a noun, so it should be used as the subject of the sentence without an unnecessary article."},{"incorrect":"✗ The app is touch-centric.","correct":"✓ The app exhibits touch-centricity. / ✓ The app has a touch-centric design.","note":"'Touch-centric' is an adjective.

It means to open something using a zipper, or it can refer to a person or tool that does this. It's less common than 'unzip,' but the meaning is easily understood from its components: 'un-' (meaning to undo) and 'zipper.' The term is more prevalent in American English. Understanding the context is key to interpreting whether it's a noun (the person or tool) or a verb (the action of unzipping)."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The child struggled to **unzipper** his backpack.","translation":"子供はリュックサックのジッパーを下ろすのに苦労した。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"ジッパーを下げる"},{"sentence":"She bought a special **unzipper** to help with her arthritis.","translation":"彼女は関節炎のために、特別なジッパーを下げる道具を買った。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"ジッパーを下げる道具"}]}

This can involve a variety of effects, such as changing its shape, releasing it from a cage, or initiating a chemical reaction. It is commonly used in biology, chemistry, and medicine for targeted drug delivery, controlling protein activity, and other applications where precise spatial and temporal control is needed.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The photoactivation was done in darkness.","correct":"✓ The photoactivation was done with a specific wavelength of light.","note":"Photoactivation requires light; it cannot occur in darkness."},{"incorrect":"✗ Photoactivation is the same as photosynthesis.","correct":"✓ Photoactivation is a process of activating molecules with light, while photosynthesis is the process of converting light energy into chemical energy.","note":"Photoactivation is a more general term, while photosynthesis is a specific biological process."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["photoactivate (verb)","photoactivated (adjective)"],"related_terms":["photochemistry","photobiology","optogenetics"],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C1","frequency_google_ngram":"低頻度 (Low frequency) - 専門的な科学分野で使われる用語。","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"「**photoactivation**」は、光を使って分子や物質を活性化するプロセスのことです。これは、薬を特定の場所に届けるためや、タンパク質の活動を制御するために、生物学、化学、医学などの分野で使われます。この言葉は専門的なので、科学論文や研究発表などでよく見られます。"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The researchers used **photoactivation** to release the drug only in the tumor cells.","translation":"研究者たちは光活性化を用いて、薬剤を腫瘍細胞内でのみ放出させた。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"光活性化"},{"sentence":"**Photoactivation** allows for precise control over the timing and location of biological events.","translation":"光活性化により、生物学的イベントのタイミングと場所を正確に制御できる。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"光活性化"}]}

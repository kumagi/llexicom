It describes an argument or demonstration that resembles a formal proof but lacks the necessary rigor or completeness. It is often used as a preliminary step or a heuristic approach to explore a problem before attempting a full proof. Understanding this term requires familiarity with the concept of mathematical proof and its importance in establishing the validity of a statement.","priority":"★☆☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The engineer used a quasi-proof to justify the design of the bridge, pending a full structural analysis.","translation":"エンジニアは、完全な構造解析を待つ間、橋の設計を正当化するために準証明を使用した。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"argument resembling a proof"},{"sentence":"While not a formal proof, the quasi-proof suggested that the algorithm would converge.","translation":"正式な証明ではないものの、その準証明はアルゴリズムが収束することを示唆していた。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"argument resembling a proof"},{"sentence":"The researcher presented a quasi-proof based on simulation results, but the mathematical community remained skeptical.","translation":"研究者はシミュレーション結果に基づいて準証明を提示したが、数学界は懐疑的なままだった。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"argument resembling a proof"}]}

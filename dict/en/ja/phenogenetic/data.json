Understanding this term requires familiarity with basic genetic concepts such as 'phenotype' (observable traits) and 'genotype' (genetic makeup). It describes the relationship between genes and the development of these observable traits, often involving complex pathways and environmental interactions. This term is more likely to be encountered in advanced scientific literature or discussions.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The researchers investigated the phenogenetic basis of the observed variation in flower color.","translation":"研究者らは、観察された花の色における変動の表現遺伝的基盤を調査した。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"表現型発生の"},{"sentence":"Understanding the phenogenetic mechanisms is crucial for predicting the effects of genetic mutations.","translation":"表現遺伝的メカニズムの理解は、遺伝子変異の影響を予測するために重要である。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"表現型発生の"}]}

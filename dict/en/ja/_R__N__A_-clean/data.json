This is crucial in molecular biology experiments where RNA integrity is essential. Contamination with even trace amounts of RNA or RNases can degrade the sample and compromise the results. Common methods to achieve an RNA-clean environment include using disposable, pre-treated labware, cleaning surfaces with RNase-decontaminating solutions, and working in designated areas.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The RNA-clean is important for PCR.","correct":"✓ Using RNA-clean reagents is important for PCR.","note":"'RNA-clean' is an adjective; it describes something.

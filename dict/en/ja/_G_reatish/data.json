It's formed by adding '-ish' to 'great,' which softens the meaning. If something is 'greatish,' it's better than average, but not exceptionally good. It's useful when you want to avoid overstating the quality or size of something. For example, 'The project was a greatish success' means the project was somewhat successful, but not a complete triumph."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The view from the hill was greatish, offering a decent panorama of the valley.","translation":"丘からの眺めはまあまあで、谷のまずまずのパノラマを見ることができた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"moderately impressive"},{"sentence":"The cake was of greatish size, enough to feed a small party.","translation":"ケーキはやや大きめで、小規模なパーティーで食べるには十分だった。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"somewhat large"},{"sentence":"Her presentation was a greatish improvement over her previous attempts.","translation":"彼女のプレゼンテーションは以前の試みからやや改善されていた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"fairly good"}]}

A low resistivity indicates that the material allows electrical current to flow easily (a good conductor), while a high resistivity indicates that the material resists the flow of electrical current (a poor conductor or an insulator). Resistivity is typically denoted by the Greek letter rho (ρ). It is measured in ohm-meters (Ω⋅m). Unlike resistance, which depends on the size and shape of the material, resistivity is an inherent property of the material itself.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The resistance is a material property.","correct":"✓ The resistivity is a material property.","note":"Resistance depends on the dimensions of the material, while resistivity is a material property independent of dimensions."},{"incorrect":"✗ High resistivity means good conductivity.","correct":"✓ High resistivity means poor conductivity.","note":"High resistivity implies that the material does not conduct electricity well."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["resistive (adjective)","resistor (noun)","resistance (noun)"],"related_scientific_terms":["conductivity","Ohm's law","electric field","current density"],"priority":"★★★"},"level_frequency":{"level":"Technical/Scientific","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency (technical term)","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Resistivity' is a technical term used in physics and electrical engineering. It describes how much a material opposes the flow of electricity. Materials with low resistivity, like copper, are good conductors, while materials with high resistivity, like rubber, are insulators.

It refers specifically to the blue pigment produced by the diatom Haslea ostrearia. This pigment is notable because it can be absorbed by oysters, causing them to turn green, a phenomenon known as oyster greening. While this greening is harmless, it can affect the perceived quality and marketability of the oysters.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Marennin is a type of algae.","correct":"✓ Marennin is a pigment produced by a type of algae (diatom).","note":"Marennin is not the algae itself, but a pigment produced by it."},{"incorrect":"✗ Marennin is toxic to humans.","correct":"✓ Marennin is not toxic to humans.","note":"Marennin is harmless, although the green color it imparts to oysters may be unappealing to some consumers."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["marennine (adjective)"],"phrasal_verbs":[],"priority":"★☆☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"N/A","frequency_google_ngram":"非常に低頻度 (Very low frequency) - 専門用語。","priority":"☆☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C2","text":"'Marennin' is a highly specialized term used in scientific contexts, particularly in marine biology and aquaculture.

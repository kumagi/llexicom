'Illiterate' comes from the Latin 'illiteratus', meaning 'unlettered' or 'ignorant of letters'. This is formed from 'in-' (not) + 'literatus' (lettered, learned), from 'littera' (letter).","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/ɪˈlɪtərətlɪ/","syllables":"il-lit-er-ate-ly"},"inflection":{"notes":"Adverbs do not inflect."},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Illiterately' describes the manner in which someone performs an action, emphasizing their lack of literacy. It is used to describe actions performed due to an inability to read or write, or more broadly, a lack of education. It is relatively uncommon in modern usage, as more common terms like 'ignorantly' or 'uneducatedly' often suffice.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ He behaved illiterately at the party.","correct":"✓ He behaved rudely/ignorantly at the party.","note":"'Illiterately' specifically refers to a lack of reading and writing skills, not general bad behavior.

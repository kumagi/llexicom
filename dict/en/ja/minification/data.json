Smaller file sizes lead to faster download times, which improves website performance and user experience. While minification improves performance, it makes the code more difficult to read and debug. Therefore, it's common practice to maintain separate development and production versions of the code. Development versions are well-formatted and commented for easy understanding, while production versions are minified for optimal performance.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Minification makes the code more readable.","correct":"✓ Minification makes the code less readable.","note":"Minification removes whitespace and comments, making the code harder to understand, not easier."},{"incorrect":"✗ Minification adds functionality to the code.","correct":"✓ Minification does not change the functionality of the code.","note":"Minification only removes unnecessary characters; it doesn't alter the code's behavior."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["minify (verb)","minified (adjective)"],"phrasal_verbs":[],"related_concepts":["uglification","obfuscation","compression","bundling","optimization"]},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Minification' refers to the process of making computer code smaller by removing unnecessary characters like spaces and comments.

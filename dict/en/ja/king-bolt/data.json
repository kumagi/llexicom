It has two primary applications:\n\n1.  **Vehicle Steering:** In older vehicles (especially trucks and heavy machinery), the king-bolt (often called a 'kingpin' in this context) is a crucial part of the steering system, connecting the axle to the steering knuckle and allowing the wheels to pivot for turning.\n2.  **Truss Structures:** In structural engineering, a king-bolt (or 'king post') is a central vertical member in a truss that supports the tie beam and helps distribute the load.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The kingbolt was quiete worn.","correct":"✓ The king-bolt was quite worn.","note":"Correct spelling of 'quite' and 'king-bolt' is essential.

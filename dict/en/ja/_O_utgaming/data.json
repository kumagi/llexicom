It implies more than just winning; it suggests a level of mastery and planning that allows one player to consistently outsmart and outperform another. The term can be used as both a verb and a noun, referring to the action of outgaming and the quality of being able to do so, respectively. Because it's a relatively new term specific to gaming culture, it may not be widely understood outside of that context."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The player's ability to outgame opponents consistently made them a top contender.","translation":"そのプレイヤーの対戦相手を常に上回る能力が、彼らをトップ候補にした。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"打ち負かす"},{"sentence":"Their strategic outgaming led to a decisive victory.","translation":"彼らの戦略的な打ち負かしが、決定的な勝利につながった。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"戦略で上回ること"}]}

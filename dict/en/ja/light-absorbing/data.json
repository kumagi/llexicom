This property is important in various applications, such as solar panels, where light needs to be captured to generate electricity, and in coatings designed to reduce glare. The degree to which a material is light-absorbing can vary, with some materials being highly light-absorbing (appearing very dark) and others being only slightly light-absorbing.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The light-absorbing is good in this material.","correct":"✓ The light-absorbing property is good in this material.","note":"'Light-absorbing' is an adjective, so it needs to modify a noun.

It describes objects or data structures that can be converted into a format suitable for storage (e.g., in a file or database) or transmission (e.g., over a network). The process of converting an object into this format is called \"serialization,\" and the reverse process is called \"deserialization.\" In Java, a class is made serializable by implementing the `Serializable` interface.

It means that an object can be turned into a series of bytes so that it can be saved to a file, sent over a network, or stored in a database. This process is called serialization. The opposite process, turning the bytes back into an object, is called deserialization. If a class is 'serializable,' it means that objects of that class can be serialized. This is important for saving and retrieving data in programs."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"To make an object serializable in Java, the class must implement the `Serializable` interface.","translation":"Javaでオブジェクトをシリアライズ可能にするには、クラスは`Serializable`インターフェースを実装する必要があります。","type":"technical documentation","meaning_category":"programming"},{"sentence":"The serializable data can be easily stored in a file or transmitted over a network.","translation":"シリアライズ可能なデータは、ファイルに簡単に保存したり、ネットワーク経由で送信したりできます。","type":"general explanation","meaning_category":"data handling"},{"sentence":"JSON is a popular format for representing serializable objects in web applications.","translation":"JSONは、Webアプリケーションでシリアライズ可能なオブジェクトを表現するための一般的なフォーマットです。","type":"web development","meaning_category":"data format"}]}

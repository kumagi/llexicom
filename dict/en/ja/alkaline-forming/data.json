It refers to foods that, after digestion and metabolism, leave alkaline residues in the body, which can potentially raise the body's pH level. This concept is central to the alkaline diet, which aims to promote health by consuming more alkaline-forming foods and fewer acid-forming foods. However, the scientific validity of the alkaline diet is debated, as the body has its own mechanisms for regulating pH levels.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Alkaline-forming is very important for the body because it has a lot of vitamins.","correct":"✓ Alkaline-forming foods are important for the body because they can help balance pH levels.","note":"The term 'alkaline-forming' describes a property of foods, not a direct source of vitamins.

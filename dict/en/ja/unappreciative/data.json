Therefore, 'unappreciative' means the opposite: 'not showing gratitude or not valuing something.' This word is used to describe someone who does not recognize or acknowledge the worth of something, often someone who has received help or a gift but does not express thanks or show that they value it. It's important to note that 'unappreciated' means 'not valued,' while 'unappreciative' means 'not showing gratitude.'"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The spoiled child was unappreciative of the expensive gifts he received.","translation":"その甘やかされた子供は、もらった高価な贈り物に感謝しなかった。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"not showing gratitude"},{"sentence":"It's frustrating to work hard for someone who is unappreciative.","translation":"感謝しない人のために一生懸命働くのはイライラする。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"not showing gratitude"},{"sentence":"The artist felt unappreciated by the critics.","translation":"そのアーティストは評論家から評価されていないと感じた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"not valued (related meaning)"}]}

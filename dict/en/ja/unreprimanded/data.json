It means that someone has not been officially scolded or criticized for something they did wrong. The word is formed by adding the prefix 'un-' to 'reprimanded,' which is the past participle of the verb 'reprimand' (to scold or criticize formally). Because of its formality and infrequent use, it is more likely to be encountered in written texts, especially those dealing with formal situations or legal matters."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"Despite the clear violation of company policy, the manager remained unreprimanded.","translation":"会社の方針の明確な違反にもかかわらず、そのマネージャーは叱責されなかった。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"not reprimanded"},{"sentence":"The student was surprised to find himself unreprimanded after turning in the assignment late.","translation":"その学生は、宿題を遅れて提出した後、自分が叱責されなかったことに驚いた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"not reprimanded"}]}

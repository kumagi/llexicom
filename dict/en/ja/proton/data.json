The number of protons in the nucleus determines the element's atomic number and thus its chemical properties. Protons are relatively heavy compared to electrons and are considered to be stable particles, although some theories predict proton decay over extremely long timescales.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The atom has 6 protons, so it is a oxygen atom.","correct":"✓ The atom has 6 protons, so it is a carbon atom.","note":"An atom with 6 protons is a carbon atom, not an oxygen atom.

It has a positive electrical charge. Protons are found in the center of the atom, which is called the nucleus. The number of protons in an atom determines what kind of element it is, like hydrogen, oxygen, or gold. Understanding protons is important for learning about chemistry and how the world works at a very small level.

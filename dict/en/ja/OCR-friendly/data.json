{"ocr_guidelines":{"description":"Guidelines for creating OCR-friendly text","font_selection":{"recommendation":"Use clear, sans-serif fonts like Arial, Helvetica, or Verdana.","reasoning":"These fonts have consistent stroke widths and minimal decorative elements, making them easier for OCR engines to process."},"font_size":{"recommendation":"Use a font size of 12 points or larger.","reasoning":"Smaller fonts can become pixelated or blurry, reducing OCR accuracy."},"font_style":{"recommendation":"Avoid using italic, bold, or underlined text unless absolutely necessary.","reasoning":"These styles can distort the shapes of characters and make them harder to recognize."},"line_spacing":{"recommendation":"Use adequate line spacing (leading) to prevent lines from overlapping.","reasoning":"Overlapping lines can confuse the OCR engine and lead to errors."},"character_spacing":{"recommendation":"Avoid excessive character spacing (tracking) or kerning.","reasoning":"Inconsistent spacing can make it difficult for the OCR engine to identify individual characters and words."},"image_quality":{"recommendation":"Use high-resolution images (300 DPI or higher).","reasoning":"Higher resolution images contain more detail, which improves OCR accuracy."},"image_contrast":{"recommendation":"Ensure sufficient contrast between the text and the background.","reasoning":"Low contrast can make it difficult for the OCR engine to distinguish the text from the background."},"image_orientation":{"recommendation":"Ensure that the image is properly oriented (not rotated or skewed).","reasoning":"Incorrect orientation can significantly reduce OCR accuracy."},"image_cleanliness":{"recommendation":"Remove any noise, artifacts, or blemishes from the image.","reasoning":"These imperfections can interfere with the OCR process."},"text_alignment":{"recommendation":"Use left-aligned or justified text.","reasoning":"Centered or right-aligned text can be more difficult for OCR engines to process."},"language_selection":{"recommendation":"Specify the language of the text to the OCR engine.","reasoning":"This helps the OCR engine use the correct character set and language models."},"special_characters":{"recommendation":"Use standard character encodings (e.g., UTF-8) and avoid unusual or decorative characters.","reasoning":"Some OCR engines may not support all character encodings or special characters."},"document_structure":{"recommendation":"Maintain a clear and consistent document structure with headings, paragraphs, and lists.","reasoning":"This helps the OCR engine understand the logical flow of the text."},"testing":{"recommendation":"Test the OCR accuracy with different engines and settings.","reasoning":"Different OCR engines may perform better with different types of text and images."},"additional_notes":["Avoid using handwritten text, as it is very difficult for OCR engines to recognize.","If possible, use a text-based format (e.g., PDF with selectable text) instead of an image-based format.","Consider using pre-processing techniques like deskewing, noise reduction, and contrast enhancement to improve image quality before OCR."]}}

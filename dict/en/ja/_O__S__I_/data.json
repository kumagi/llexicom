It's a conceptual model that standardizes the communication functions of a telecommunication or computing system without regard to its underlying internal structure and technology. It divides the communication system into seven abstract layers: Application, Presentation, Session, Transport, Network, Data Link, and Physical. Each layer builds upon the functions provided by the layer below it.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The OSI is a hardware.","correct":"✓ The OSI model is a conceptual framework.","note":"The OSI model is a conceptual model, not a piece of hardware."},{"incorrect":"✗ I use OSI for my internet.","correct":"✓ My network architecture is based on the OSI model.","note":"The OSI model is a reference model, not a specific technology you 'use'."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["OSI model","OSI layer 1 (Physical Layer)","OSI layer 2 (Data Link Layer)","OSI layer 3 (Network Layer)","OSI layer 4 (Transport Layer)","OSI layer 5 (Session Layer)","OSI layer 6 (Presentation Layer)","OSI layer 7 (Application Layer)"],"priority":"★★★"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C1 (Technical vocabulary)","frequency_google_ngram":"Moderate frequency in technical contexts.","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"The term 'OSI' refers to the Open Systems Interconnection model, a conceptual framework used in computer networking.

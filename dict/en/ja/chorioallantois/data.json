In birds and reptiles, it lies just beneath the shell and facilitates gas exchange (oxygen intake and carbon dioxide removal). In mammals, it contributes to the formation of the placenta. The chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay is a common experimental technique used in biological and medical research to study angiogenesis, tumor growth, and drug delivery.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The corioallantois is responsible for nutrient absorption.","correct":"✓ The chorioallantois is responsible for gas exchange.","note":"The primary function of the chorioallantois is gas exchange, not nutrient absorption.

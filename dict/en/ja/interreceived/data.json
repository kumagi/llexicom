It describes a scenario where two or more devices or systems mutually receive signals or data from each other. Due to its niche usage, it's unlikely to be encountered outside of technical documentation and discussions. It's important to distinguish it from general terms like \"receive\" or \"exchange,\" as it specifically implies bidirectional reception.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The satellite and the ground station interreceived telemetry data.","translation":"衛星と地上局はテレメトリデータを相互受信した。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"相互受信"},{"sentence":"The sensor network is designed to ensure that all nodes interreceive environmental data.","translation":"そのセンサーネットワークは、すべてのノードが環境データを相互受信するように設計されている。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"相互受信"}]}

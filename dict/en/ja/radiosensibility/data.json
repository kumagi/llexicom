High radiosensibility indicates that a small dose of radiation can cause significant damage, while low radiosensibility (radioresistance) means that a larger dose is needed to produce the same effect. This concept is crucial in radiation therapy, where the goal is to selectively destroy cancer cells while minimizing damage to surrounding healthy tissues. Factors affecting radiosensibility include cell type, oxygen levels, and the presence of certain chemicals.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The radiosensibility of the material was measured in volts.","correct":"✓ The radiosensibility of the material was measured by the dose required to cause a specific effect.","note":"Radiosensibility is related to the dose of radiation, not voltage."},{"incorrect":"✗ Radiosensibility is the same as radioactivity.","correct":"✓ Radiosensibility is the susceptibility to radiation damage, while radioactivity is the property of emitting radiation.","note":"Radiosensibility is the ability to be damaged by radiation, whereas radioactivity is the property of emitting radiation."}],"priority":"★☆☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["radiosensitive (形容詞: 放射線に敏感な)","radiosensitizer (名詞: 放射線増感剤)","radioprotector (名詞: 放射線防護剤)","radiobiology (名詞: 放射線生物学)"],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Radiosensibility' is a technical term primarily used in the fields of radiation biology and oncology.

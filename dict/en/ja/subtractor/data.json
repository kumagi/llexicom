There are two main types: half subtractors and full subtractors. A half subtractor performs subtraction on two single-bit binary numbers, while a full subtractor handles a borrow-in bit from a previous stage, allowing for multi-bit subtraction.","priority":"N/A"},"level_frequency":{"frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency","priority":"N/A"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"Advanced","text":"This term is primarily used in the context of digital electronics and computer architecture.

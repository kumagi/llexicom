It describes a type of filter that allows high-frequency signals to pass through while reducing the amplitude of lower-frequency signals. It is commonly used to remove unwanted low-frequency noise or to emphasize the higher frequencies in a signal. As an adjective, it modifies terms like 'filter' or 'circuit'. As a noun, it refers to the filter itself.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ high pass filter","correct":"✓ high-pass filter","note":"It should be hyphenated when used as a compound adjective before a noun."},{"incorrect":"✗ highpassed filter","correct":"✓ high-pass filter","note":"'High-pass' is the standard term; 'highpassed' is not typically used."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["high-pass filtering"],"phrasal_verbs":[],"related_terms":["low-pass","band-pass","band-stop","filter","cutoff frequency","attenuation","signal processing","audio engineering"],"priority":"★★★"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C1","frequency_google_ngram":"Relatively low frequency, technical term.","priority":"★★☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'High-pass' is a technical term used in electronics and audio engineering.

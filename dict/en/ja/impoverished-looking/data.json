It is a more descriptive and nuanced way of saying that someone \"looks poor.\" It is often used in literature or descriptive writing to create a vivid image of poverty. Because it is a compound adjective, it is slightly more complex than simply saying \"poor.\" It suggests a visual impression of poverty rather than a definitive statement of actual poverty.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The refugees arrived at the camp, tired and impoverished-looking.","translation":"難民たちは疲れ果て、貧しそうな様子でキャンプに到着した。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"貧困に見える"},{"sentence":"The abandoned factory was an impoverished-looking relic of the town's industrial past.","translation":"その廃墟となった工場は、町の産業の過去の貧しそうな遺物だった。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"貧困に見える"},{"sentence":"Despite her talent, she had an impoverished-looking studio with very little equipment.","translation":"彼女の才能にもかかわらず、彼女は非常に少ない設備しかない貧しそうなスタジオを持っていた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"貧困に見える"}]}

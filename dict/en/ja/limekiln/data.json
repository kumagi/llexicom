This process involves heating limestone (calcium carbonate) at high temperatures, typically around 900°C, to produce quicklime (calcium oxide). Quicklime has various uses in construction, agriculture, and chemical industries, including making cement, mortar, plaster, and as a soil stabilizer. Limekilns were historically common in areas with abundant limestone deposits, often near quarries or building sites. They come in different designs, such as bottle kilns, intermittent kilns, and continuous kilns, but all share the basic principle of burning limestone to create quicklime."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The old **limekiln** stood as a reminder of the area's industrial past.","translation":"古い石灰焼成炉は、この地域の産業の過去を思い起こさせるものとして残っていた。","type":"Historical context","meaning_category":"Past Industrial Site"},{"sentence":"Farmers used quicklime produced from the **limekiln** to improve their soil.","translation":"農家は石灰焼成炉から作られた生石灰を使って土壌改良を行った。","type":"Agricultural use","meaning_category":"Soil Improvement"},{"sentence":"Archaeologists discovered the remains of a Roman **limekiln** during excavations.","translation":"考古学者は発掘調査中にローマ時代の石灰焼成炉の遺跡を発見した。","type":"Archaeological find","meaning_category":"Historical Discovery"},{"sentence":"The **limekiln** was a crucial part of the cement manufacturing process in the 19th century.","translation":"石灰焼成炉は19世紀のセメント製造プロセスにおいて重要な役割を果たした。","type":"Industrial Process","meaning_category":"Cement Manufacturing"},{"sentence":"Restoring the **limekiln** is a project aimed at preserving local heritage.","translation":"石灰焼成炉の修復は、地域の遺産を保存することを目的としたプロジェクトである。","type":"Preservation","meaning_category":"Heritage Preservation"}]}

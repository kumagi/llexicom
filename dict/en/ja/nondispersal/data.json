It describes the situation where seeds, spores, or offspring do not spread far from the parent organism. This concept is important for understanding plant and animal ecology, population dynamics, and adaptation to specific environments. The word is formed by adding the prefix 'non-' to 'dispersal,' which means to spread or scatter.

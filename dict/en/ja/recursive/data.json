It describes something that refers back to itself in its definition or process. In computer science, a recursive function is one that calls itself within its own code. In mathematics, a recursive definition defines a sequence or function in terms of its previous values. In linguistics, recursion refers to the ability of language to embed phrases within phrases, allowing for complex sentence structures.

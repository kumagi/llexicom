Equalization refers to the process of compensating for signal distortion in a communication channel. Therefore, 'preequalization' specifically refers to performing this compensation before the signal is transmitted.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/ˌpriːˌiːkwəlaɪˈzeɪʃən/","syllables":"pree-e-qual-i-za-tion"},"inflection":{"noun_plural":"preequalizations"},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"Preequalization is primarily used in high-speed data communication systems, such as Ethernet, fiber optics, and backplanes, to mitigate the effects of inter-symbol interference (ISI) and other channel impairments.

It refers to a technique where a signal is intentionally distorted before transmission to compensate for distortions that will occur as it travels through a channel (like a cable or fiber optic line). This pre-distortion helps ensure that the signal arrives at the receiver with improved quality. The concept is complex and requires understanding of signal processing and channel characteristics. It's typically discussed in advanced engineering contexts.","priority":"★☆☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The engineers implemented a sophisticated preequalization algorithm to improve the signal-to-noise ratio.","translation":"エンジニアは、信号対雑音比を改善するために、高度なプリイコライゼーションアルゴリズムを実装しました。","type":"technical","meaning_category":"signal processing"},{"sentence":"Effective preequalization can significantly reduce bit error rates in high-speed communication systems.","translation":"効果的なプリイコライゼーションは、高速通信システムにおけるビット誤り率を大幅に低減できます。","type":"technical","meaning_category":"telecommunications"}]}

Its key feature is a wide field of view, which is essential for navigation and surveillance purposes. Unlike standard periscopes that might have a narrower focus, the altiscope is designed to provide a broader perspective of the surrounding environment. This makes it particularly useful for detecting distant objects or potential threats.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The altiscope is used in airplanes for landing.","correct":"✓ Altiscopes are primarily used in submarines, not airplanes.","note":"Altiscopes are specifically designed for submarine use, not for aircraft.

This includes all the cells of the body, as well as the extraembryonic tissues (like the placenta). Only the zygote (fertilized egg) and the cells of the very early embryo (blastomeres) are considered truly totipotent. As development progresses, cells lose totipotency and become pluripotent (able to differentiate into many, but not all, cell types) or multipotent (able to differentiate into a limited number of cell types). The term is also sometimes used metaphorically to describe someone or something with unlimited potential.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Pluripotency is the same as totipotency.","correct":"✓ Pluripotency is similar to totipotency, but not the same. Totipotent cells can form all cell types, including extraembryonic tissues, while pluripotent cells cannot.","note":"Pluripotency and totipotency are related concepts, but totipotency is a more comprehensive ability.

It is formed by combining 'destitute' (lacking basic necessities) and 'appearing' (giving an impression). Its usage often implies a focus on the superficial or deceptive nature of appearances related to poverty. Due to its nuanced meaning and less frequent use, it is more likely to be encountered in advanced literary or descriptive contexts."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The photographer captured the haunting image of a destitute-appearing family huddled together for warmth.","translation":"その写真家は、暖を求めて身を寄せ合う貧困に見える家族の忘れがたいイメージを捉えた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"貧困に見える"},{"sentence":"The actor transformed himself with makeup and ragged clothes into a destitute-appearing character for the play.","translation":"その俳優は、メイクとぼろぼろの服で、劇のために貧困に見えるキャラクターに変身した。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"貧困に見える"},{"sentence":"The charity worker was moved by the plight of the destitute-appearing refugees.","translation":"慈善団体の職員は、貧困に見える難民の窮状に心を打たれた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"貧困に見える"}]}

It involves a systematic analysis of the possible ways a product or process can fail, the effects of those failures, and the likelihood and severity of their occurrence. The goal of FMEA is to identify and prioritize potential failures so that corrective actions can be taken to prevent or minimize their impact. This technique is commonly used in engineering and quality management to improve reliability and safety.

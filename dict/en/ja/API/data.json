It allows developers to use pre-built functions and data from other applications or services, rather than having to write code from scratch. APIs are essential for modern software development, enabling integration, modularity, and efficiency. There are various types of APIs, including REST APIs, SOAP APIs, and GraphQL APIs, each with its own architectural style and communication protocols.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ I used the API to code the program.","correct":"✓ I used the API to develop the program.","note":"The API is not used to \"code\" a program, but rather to \"develop\" or \"integrate\" features into a program.

It's like a set of rules that allows different software programs to talk to each other. Imagine it as a waiter in a restaurant: you (the application) tell the waiter (the API) what you want (request), and the waiter gets it from the kitchen (the other software) and brings it back to you (response).

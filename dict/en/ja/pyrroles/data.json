'Pyrrol' comes from the Greek 'pyrros' (πυρρός), meaning 'fiery' or 'fire-colored', because pyrroles give a red color to wood when moistened with hydrochloric acid. The suffix '-ole' indicates a heterocyclic aromatic compound.","priority":"★★★"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/ˈpɪroʊlz/","syllables":"pyr-roles"},"inflection":{"noun_plural":"pyrroles"},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Pyrroles' is the plural form of 'pyrrole'. Pyrrole is a fundamental heterocyclic aromatic organic compound. It is a building block in many natural products, including heme (in hemoglobin) and chlorophyll. The term 'pyrroles' is used when referring to multiple compounds containing the pyrrole ring structure or when discussing the class of compounds in general.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{},"related_words":{"derivatives":["pyrrole","pyrrolic","porphyrin","heme","chlorophyll"],"related_terms":["furan","thiophene","imidazole","heterocycle","aromatic compound"],"priority":"★★★"},"level_frequency":{"frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency - Primarily used in chemistry and biochemistry contexts.","priority":"★★☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Pyrroles' refers to a specific class of organic compounds primarily discussed in chemistry and biochemistry.

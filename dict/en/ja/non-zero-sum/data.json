It describes situations where cooperation can lead to mutual benefits, as opposed to zero-sum scenarios where one party's gain necessarily means another's loss. It emphasizes the possibility of creating value and mutual benefit through collaboration and strategic interaction. It is often used to promote the idea that cooperation is a more effective strategy than competition in certain situations.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ This is a non-zero sum, so someone has to lose.","correct":"✓ This is a zero-sum game, so someone has to lose. / ✓ This is a non-zero-sum game, so everyone can potentially benefit.","note":"The core concept of non-zero-sum is that not necessarily someone has to lose.

This means that it's possible for everyone involved to benefit, or at least for some to benefit without necessarily causing others to lose.

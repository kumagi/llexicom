It describes a process where the strength or intensity of something, like a signal, is reduced evenly across its entire range. This term is mainly used in fields like engineering or physics. If something is 'linear-attenuated', it means the reduction is consistent and predictable, following a straight-line relationship.","priority":"★☆☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The engineers decided to linear-attenuate the audio signal to match the dynamic range of the recording equipment.","translation":"エンジニアは、録音機器のダイナミックレンジに合わせるために、オーディオ信号を線形減衰させることにしました。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"signal processing"}]}

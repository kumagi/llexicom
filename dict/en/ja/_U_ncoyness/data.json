Coyness involves being deliberately shy, modest, or flirtatious, often in a playful or teasing manner. Therefore, \"uncoyness\" implies a lack of such behavior, suggesting instead a more direct, open, and possibly bold approach. It can be seen as a positive trait, indicating honesty and straightforwardness, or it can be viewed negatively, depending on the context and cultural norms regarding modesty and reserve.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ He showed uncoyness behavior.","correct":"✓ He showed uncoyness. / ✓ He behaved with uncoyness.","note":"\"Uncoyness\" is a noun, so it describes a state or quality.

It is similar in meaning to 'aber' (but), but is generally considered more formal and literary. It can often be replaced by 'aber' without significantly changing the meaning, but 'jedoch' adds a slightly more emphatic or refined tone.

While 'aber' is perfectly acceptable in most situations, 'jedoch' can add a more sophisticated tone to your writing. It's important to remember not to use both 'aber' and 'jedoch' in the same clause, as they have the same function. Also, while it can start a sentence, it usually sounds better placed after the verb or subject in the second clause."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"Das Wetter war schlecht, jedoch gingen wir spazieren.","translation":"The weather was bad, but we went for a walk anyway.","type":"conjunction","meaning_category":"contrast"},{"sentence":"Er hatte wenig Geld, jedoch war er glücklich.","translation":"He had little money, yet he was happy.","type":"conjunction","meaning_category":"contrast"},{"sentence":"Sie versprach zu kommen, jedoch kam sie nicht.","translation":"She promised to come, but she didn't.","type":"conjunction","meaning_category":"contrast"}]}

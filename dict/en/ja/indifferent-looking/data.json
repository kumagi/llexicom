It's formed by combining 'indifferent' (not caring) and 'looking' (having a certain appearance). The word is used to describe someone's face, expression, or general demeanor. It implies that the person's outward appearance does not show any emotional engagement or interest in what is happening around them. This word is more nuanced and less common than simply saying someone 'looks indifferent.'"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The security guard had an indifferent-looking face as he scanned the crowd.","translation":"警備員は群衆をスキャンしながら、無関心そうな顔をしていた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"appearance"},{"sentence":"She gave an indifferent-looking wave as she walked past.","translation":"彼女は通り過ぎる際、無関心そうなそぶりで手を振った。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"appearance"},{"sentence":"The witness gave an indifferent-looking account of the events.","translation":"証人は出来事について、無関心そうな様子で説明した。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"appearance"}]}

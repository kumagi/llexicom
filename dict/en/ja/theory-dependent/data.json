It describes the idea that our observations and understandings are influenced by the theories we hold. This means that what we see and how we interpret it is not purely objective but is shaped by our pre-existing beliefs and theoretical frameworks. The term is often used to challenge the notion of purely objective observation and to highlight the role of theory in shaping our understanding of the world."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The interpretation of quantum mechanics is highly theory-dependent, with different interpretations leading to different understandings of the same phenomena.","translation":"量子力学の解釈は高度に理論依存的であり、異なる解釈は同じ現象に対する異なる理解につながる。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"理論に依存する"},{"sentence":"Critics argue that his analysis is too theory-dependent and fails to account for empirical evidence.","translation":"批評家たちは、彼の分析は理論依存的すぎ、経験的証拠を考慮していないと主張する。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"理論に依存する"}]}

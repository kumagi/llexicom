It's often used when talking about business or the economy. For example, if a car factory can make 1 million cars a year but only sells 500,000, it has \"overcapacity.\" This can lead to problems because the factory is not using all its resources efficiently. It is also used to describe situations where a place is too full, like a prison or a hospital. This word is more common in specialized discussions about economics and industry.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The steel industry is facing significant overcapacity.","translation":"鉄鋼業界は深刻な過剰生産能力に直面している。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"過剰能力"},{"sentence":"The government is trying to address the problem of overcapacity in the coal sector.","translation":"政府は石炭部門における過剰能力の問題に対処しようとしている。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"過剰能力"},{"sentence":"The hospital was forced to turn patients away due to overcapacity.","translation":"その病院は定員超過のため、患者を断らざるを得なかった。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"定員超過"},{"sentence":"The overcapacity in the market led to lower prices.","translation":"市場における過剰能力は価格の低下につながった。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"過剰能力"}]}

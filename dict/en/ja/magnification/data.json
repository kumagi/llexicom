It's often used when talking about microscopes or telescopes, where the magnification tells you how much larger the object appears. For example, a microscope with a magnification of 100x makes the object look 100 times bigger. The word can also be used to describe exaggerating something, like saying someone is using \"magnification\" when they're making a problem seem worse than it really is.

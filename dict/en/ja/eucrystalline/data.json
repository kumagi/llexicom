It indicates that the entire rock is composed of crystals, meaning there is no glassy or amorphous (non-crystalline) material present. This texture typically results from slow cooling, which allows sufficient time for crystals to form and grow.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"The eucrystalline rock had a glassy appearance.","correct":"The eucrystalline rock consisted entirely of crystals.","note":"Eucrystalline rocks, by definition, do not have a glassy appearance.

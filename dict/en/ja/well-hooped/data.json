Its primary meaning relates to barrels or casks that are securely fitted with hoops. The figurative sense, implying something is well-organized or strongly constructed, is even less common. Understanding requires familiarity with the literal image of a barrel tightly bound with hoops and the ability to extend this image metaphorically. Due to its rarity and specialized nature, it is unlikely to be encountered outside of specific contexts (e.g., historical literature, discussions of barrel-making)."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The cooper carefully inspected the well-hooped barrel to ensure it would hold the wine.","translation":"桶屋はワインを保持できるように、箍がしっかりとはめられた樽を注意深く検査した。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"Securely fitted with hoops"},{"sentence":"Their well-hooped strategy ensured success in the competitive market.","translation":"彼らのしっかりと組織された戦略は、競争の激しい市場での成功を保証した。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"Well-organized (figurative)"}]}

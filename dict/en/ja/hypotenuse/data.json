It's a term commonly used in geometry and trigonometry. Understanding the hypotenuse is essential for applying the Pythagorean theorem, which relates the lengths of the sides of a right triangle: a² + b² = c², where 'c' represents the length of the hypotenuse, and 'a' and 'b' represent the lengths of the other two sides (called legs)."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The length of the **hypotenuse** can be found using the Pythagorean theorem.","translation":"斜辺の長さはピタゴラスの定理を使って求めることができます。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"斜辺"},{"sentence":"In a 3-4-5 right triangle, the **hypotenuse** is 5.","translation":"3-4-5の直角三角形では、斜辺は5です。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"斜辺"},{"sentence":"The **hypotenuse** is always opposite the right angle.","translation":"斜辺は常に直角の反対側にあります。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"斜辺"}]}

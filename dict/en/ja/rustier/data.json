'Rusty' describes something covered in rust (the reddish-brown coating on iron or steel caused by oxidation) or something that has become less effective because it hasn't been used for a while. So, 'rustier' means something has more rust or is more out of practice than something else. For example, 'This old bike is rustier than my new one' means the old bike has more rust on it. Or, 'My Spanish is rustier than my English' means your Spanish skills are not as good as your English skills because you haven't practiced Spanish recently."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The hinges on the garden gate were **rustier** than I remembered.","translation":"庭の門の蝶番は、私が覚えていたよりも錆びていた。","type":"adjective (comparative)","meaning_category":"錆びた"},{"sentence":"After years of disuse, his piano skills were **rustier** than he expected.","translation":"何年も使わなかった後、彼のピアノの腕は予想以上に錆び付いていた。","type":"adjective (comparative)","meaning_category":"時代遅れの"},{"sentence":"The old tools in the shed were much **rustier** than the ones he kept in the garage.","translation":"物置の古い道具は、彼がガレージに保管していたものよりもずっと錆びていた。","type":"adjective (comparative)","meaning_category":"錆びた"}]}

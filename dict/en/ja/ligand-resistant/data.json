A ligand is a molecule that binds to another molecule, usually a protein. So, if something is ligand-resistant, it means it doesn't bind to or get activated by its usual ligand. This term is used in science, especially when talking about how drugs or other molecules interact with cells."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The cancer cells became ligand-resistant after prolonged exposure to the drug.","translation":"がん細胞は薬物に長期間さらされた後、リガンド耐性になった。","type":"scientific","meaning_category":"リガンド耐性"},{"sentence":"We are studying the mechanism by which the receptor becomes ligand-resistant.","translation":"受容体がリガンド耐性になるメカニズムを研究している。","type":"scientific","meaning_category":"リガンド耐性"}]}

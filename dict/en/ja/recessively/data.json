A trait is said to be inherited recessively if it is only expressed when an individual has two copies of the recessive gene responsible for that trait. If an individual has only one copy of the recessive gene and one copy of a dominant gene, the dominant gene will mask the effect of the recessive gene, and the trait will not be expressed.

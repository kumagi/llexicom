It describes the process or tendency of something becoming alkaline, or the state of being slightly alkaline. Because it is a specialized term, it is not commonly used in everyday language and is more likely to be encountered in academic or professional contexts. Understanding this word requires a background knowledge of basic chemistry concepts such as pH levels and the properties of acids and bases."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The gradual alkalescency of the lake water was a concern for the local ecosystem.","translation":"湖水の徐々なアルカリ化は、地域の生態系にとって懸念事項であった。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"アルカリ性になる傾向"},{"sentence":"The experiment aimed to measure the alkalescency of the new cleaning solution.","translation":"その実験は、新しい洗浄液のアルカリ性を示す性質を測定することを目的としていた。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"アルカリ性を示す性質"}]}

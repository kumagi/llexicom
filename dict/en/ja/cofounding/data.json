It's crucial to identify and control for cofounding to obtain valid estimates of causal effects. Common methods to control for cofounding include stratification, matching, and multivariable regression.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The study was cofounding because it had too many participants.","correct":"✓ The study was confounded because it had too many cofounding variables.","note":"'Cofounding' describes the nature of the bias, not the overall quality of the study.

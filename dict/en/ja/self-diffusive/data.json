It refers to the random movement of particles (atoms, molecules, ions) within a homogeneous system, leading to a net spreading or mixing of the substance. This term is often used in the context of studying transport phenomena in liquids, solids, and gases.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The material is very diffusion.","correct":"✓ The material is very self-diffusive.","note":"'Diffusion' is a process, while 'self-diffusive' is an adjective describing the property of a material.

Because it's not a common word, it's more likely to be found in descriptive writing or literature where the author wants to emphasize the absence of vegetation. It's formed by adding the prefix \"un-\" to \"verdured,\" which itself means \"covered in green plants.\" Understanding the root word \"verdure\" (green vegetation) helps in understanding \"unverdured.\""},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The lunar surface is starkly unverdured, a landscape of rock and dust.","translation":"月の表面は、岩と塵の風景であり、全く草木がない。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"lacking vegetation"},{"sentence":"The high mountain peaks remained unverdured even in the summer months.","translation":"高い山の頂は、夏の数ヶ月でさえ草木が生い茂ることはなかった。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"lacking vegetation"},{"sentence":"They crossed the unverdured plains, the sun beating down on the dry earth.","translation":"彼らは草木のない平原を横断し、太陽が乾燥した大地を照りつけていた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"lacking vegetation"}]}

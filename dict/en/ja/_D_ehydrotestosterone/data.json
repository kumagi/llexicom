It is crucial for the development of male secondary sexual characteristics during puberty, such as facial hair growth, deepening of the voice, and muscle development. However, DHT is also implicated in several conditions, including benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), prostate cancer, and androgenetic alopecia (male pattern baldness).","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Dehydrotestosterone is a type of estrogen.","correct":"✓ Dehydrotestosterone is a type of androgen.","note":"Dehydrotestosterone is an androgen, not an estrogen.

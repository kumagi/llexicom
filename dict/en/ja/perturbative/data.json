Perturbation theory is a way to approximate the solution to a problem by starting with a known solution to a simpler, related problem and then adding small corrections (perturbations). The 'perturbative' adjective indicates that something is related to this process of approximation through small deviations. It is often contrasted with 'non-perturbative', which refers to methods that do not rely on such approximations and attempt to find exact solutions.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The perturbative effect was very strong.","correct":"✓ The perturbation effect was very strong.","note":"'Perturbative' describes the method or approach, not the effect itself.

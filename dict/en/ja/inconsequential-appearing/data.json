It's used to highlight a contrast between how something looks and its actual importance. Understanding this word requires a good grasp of both 'inconsequential' and 'appearing', and the ability to combine them to convey a nuanced meaning. Because of its length and complexity, it is not a commonly used word. It is more often found in formal writing or when trying to express a very specific idea."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The inconsequential-appearing scratch on the car revealed a deeper structural flaw.","translation":"車についた外見上は取るに足らないように見えるひっかき傷が、より深い構造的な欠陥を明らかにした。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"外見上は重要でないように見える"},{"sentence":"What seemed like an inconsequential-appearing conversation led to a life-changing opportunity.","translation":"取るに足らないように見える会話が、人生を変える機会につながった。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"外見上は重要でないように見える"}]}

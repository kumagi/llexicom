It's a formal word, so you'll usually find it in writing rather than in everyday conversation. For example, you might read that 'economic problems foreran the revolution,' meaning that the economic problems happened before and were a sign that the revolution was coming. The noun form, 'forerunner,' is more common and means something that comes before and influences what follows. For example, 'the printing press was a forerunner of the internet.'"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The rise in unemployment foreran a period of increased crime.","translation":"失業率の上昇は犯罪増加の時代に先立つものだった。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"先立つ"},{"sentence":"The steam engine was a forerun of the industrial revolution.","translation":"蒸気機関は産業革命の先駆けだった。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"先駆者"}]}

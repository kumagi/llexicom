It refers to the process of converting a chemical compound into its epimer, which is a stereoisomer differing in configuration at only one stereogenic center. The process often involves enzymes that catalyze the epimerization reaction.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{},"related_words":{"derivatives":["epimer (noun)","epimerization (noun)","epimerase (noun)"],"priority":"★★★"},"level_frequency":{},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C2","text":"'Epimerising' is a highly specialized term primarily used within the fields of chemistry and biochemistry. Understanding requires knowledge of stereochemistry and isomerism. It describes a specific type of chemical reaction where a compound is converted into its epimer, a molecule differing in configuration at only one stereocenter. This term is unlikely to be encountered outside of advanced scientific literature or discussions.

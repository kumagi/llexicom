It is often used in technical contexts, such as mathematics, logic, economics, and computer science, where precise and predictable outcomes are desired. It contrasts with 'indeterminacy', which implies a lack of fixedness or predictability.

It's often used in fields like mathematics, logic, and computer science to discuss whether a problem or system has a unique and predictable solution. If something has 'determinacy,' it means there's no ambiguity or uncertainty about its outcome or state. This word is not commonly used in everyday conversations, but it's important for understanding complex concepts in technical fields."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The **determinacy** of the algorithm ensures that it always produces the same output for a given input.","translation":"そのアルゴリズムの決定性により、特定の入力に対して常に同じ出力が生成されることが保証されます。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"確定性 (アルゴリズム)"},{"sentence":"The lack of **determinacy** in quantum mechanics leads to probabilistic predictions.","translation":"量子力学における決定性の欠如は、確率論的な予測につながります。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"決定性 (量子力学)"},{"sentence":"The **determinacy** of the legal contract is essential to avoid future disputes.","translation":"法的契約の明確性は、将来の紛争を避けるために不可欠です。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"明確性 (契約)"}]}

It refers to the condition where an organism has multiple sets of chromosomes, all originating from the same species. This is different from allopolyploidy, where the chromosome sets come from different species. Understanding autopolyploidy requires a background knowledge of genetics and chromosome structure. It is typically discussed in advanced biology courses or research settings."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"Autopolyploidy can lead to increased fruit size in some plant species.","translation":"同質倍数性は、一部の植物種において果実サイズの増加につながることがある。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"同質倍数性"},{"sentence":"The researchers created an autopolyploidy of the plant to study its effects on disease resistance.","translation":"研究者らは、病気抵抗性への影響を研究するために、その植物の同質倍数体を作製した。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"同質倍数体"}]}

It is often used in philosophical, scientific, or analytical contexts to describe a method of breaking down complex systems or ideas into smaller, more manageable parts. This approach contrasts with holistic perspectives that emphasize the interconnectedness and interdependence of elements.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The painting was viewed atomistically, focusing on the overall impression.","correct":"✓ The painting was viewed holistically, focusing on the overall impression.","note":"'Atomistically' means focusing on individual parts, not the overall impression.

It's like looking at a complex machine by studying each individual gear, wire, and bolt separately, rather than looking at the machine as a whole. This word is often used in academic or philosophical discussions when talking about how we understand complex systems or ideas. It suggests a focus on the individual elements and their properties, rather than the relationships between them or the overall structure.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The researcher examined the data atomistically to identify specific trends.","translation":"研究者は特定の傾向を特定するために、データを原子論的に調べた。","type":"general","meaning_category":"analysis"},{"sentence":"The philosopher argued that society should not be viewed atomistically, but as an interconnected whole.","translation":"哲学者は、社会は原子論的にではなく、相互につながった全体として捉えられるべきだと主張した。","type":"philosophy","meaning_category":"social theory"},{"sentence":"The software was designed to process information atomistically, handling each piece of data independently.","translation":"そのソフトウェアは、各データを個別に処理し、情報を原子論的に処理するように設計された。","type":"technology","meaning_category":"data processing"}]}

It is a pentose sugar, meaning it has five carbon atoms. Ribose differs from deoxyribose (a component of DNA) by the presence of a hydroxyl group (-OH) on the 2' carbon.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Ribose is a component of DNA.","correct":"✓ Ribose is a component of RNA.","note":"Ribose is found in RNA, while deoxyribose is found in DNA."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["ribonucleic acid (RNA)","deoxyribose","nucleoside","nucleotide"],"phrasal_verbs":[]},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"Ribose is a technical term used in biochemistry and molecular biology.

It describes the initial formation of a new phase or structure within a system. There are two main types of nucleation: homogeneous nucleation, which occurs spontaneously in a uniform system, and heterogeneous nucleation, which occurs on a surface or at an interface. The rate of nucleation is influenced by factors such as temperature, pressure, and the presence of impurities or other substances.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The nucleation was very fastly.","correct":"✓ The nucleation was very fast.","note":"'Nucleation' is a noun, so it should be modified by an adjective ('fast') rather than an adverb ('fastly').

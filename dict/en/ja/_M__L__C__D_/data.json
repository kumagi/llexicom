It is caused by a deficiency in the arylsulfatase A (ASA) enzyme, leading to the accumulation of sulfatides in the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves. This accumulation damages the myelin sheath, the protective covering around nerve fibers, resulting in neurological problems.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{},"related_words":{"derivatives":["arylsulfatase A","sulfatides","leukodystrophy"],"phrasal_verbs":[]},"level_frequency":{},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C2","text":"MLCD (Metachromatic Leukodystrophy) is a complex medical term referring to a rare genetic disease.

They are widely used in the production of polymers, especially polyurethanes, which find applications in foams, coatings, adhesives, and elastomers. Due to their reactivity, isocyanates can pose health hazards, primarily through inhalation or skin contact, leading to respiratory sensitization and dermatitis. Proper handling and ventilation are crucial when working with these chemicals.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ isocianate","correct":"✓ isocyanate","note":"Common misspelling of the word."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["polyurethane","cyanate"],"phrasal_verbs":[]},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Isocyanate' refers to a specific type of chemical compound containing the -NCO functional group.

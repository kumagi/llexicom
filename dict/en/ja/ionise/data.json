It describes the process by which an atom or molecule gains or loses electrons, resulting in the formation of ions. Understanding this term requires a basic knowledge of atomic structure and electrical charge. It is more commonly encountered in scientific literature and discussions rather than everyday conversation."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"Ultraviolet light can ionise oxygen molecules.","translation":"紫外線は酸素分子をイオン化することができる。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"Ionization"},{"sentence":"The upper atmosphere is highly ionised.","translation":"上層大気は高度にイオン化されている。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"Ionization"}]}

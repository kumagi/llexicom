It is frequently employed in medical contexts when describing growths, moles, or lesions that exhibit characteristics associated with cancerous cells, such as irregular borders, asymmetrical shape, or unusual coloration. It's crucial to understand that 'cancerous-looking' does not confirm a cancer diagnosis, but rather signals the need for further investigation through tests like biopsies. Outside of medical contexts, it can be used metaphorically to describe something harmful or destructive, likening its spread or impact to the insidious nature of cancer."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The dermatologist examined the patient's skin and noted a cancerous-looking spot near her shoulder.","translation":"皮膚科医は患者の皮膚を診察し、肩の近くに癌のような見た目の斑点があることに気づいた。","type":"medical","meaning_category":"Appearance suggestive of cancer"},{"sentence":"The cancerous-looking growth was surgically removed and sent for pathology.","translation":"その癌のような見た目の腫瘍は外科的に切除され、病理検査に送られた。","type":"medical","meaning_category":"Appearance suggestive of cancer"},{"sentence":"The company's toxic work environment had a cancerous-looking effect on employee morale.","translation":"その会社の有害な職場環境は、従業員の士気に癌のような有害な影響を与えた。","type":"figurative","meaning_category":"Harmful or destructive influence"}]}

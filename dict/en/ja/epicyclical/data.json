It has comparative and superlative forms, but they are rarely used: more epicyclical, most epicyclical."},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Epicyclical' is primarily used in technical contexts, especially in discussions of the history of astronomy and mechanics. It describes a type of circular motion where a point moves along a circle whose center is itself moving along a larger circle. This concept was historically important in explaining the apparent movements of celestial bodies.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The epicyclical shape.","correct":"✓ The epicyclical path.","note":"'Epicyclical' should be used to describe motion or a model involving epicycles, not just any shape."}],"priority":"★☆☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["epicycle","epicycloid"],"phrasal_verbs":[]},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Very Low","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C2","text":"The term 'epicyclical' is highly specialized and technical, primarily encountered in the context of advanced discussions in astronomy, physics, or the history of science.

Imagine you have a list of test scores. A histogram would group these scores into ranges (like 60-70, 70-80, etc.) and then show how many scores fall into each range using bars. The height of each bar tells you how many data points are in that range. Histograms are useful for understanding the shape and distribution of data, and are commonly used in statistics and data analysis."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The **histogram** clearly shows that most students scored between 70 and 80.","translation":"そのヒストグラムは、ほとんどの学生が70点から80点の間に点数を取ったことを明確に示しています。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"度数分布図"},{"sentence":"We generated a **histogram** to analyze the distribution of ages in the sample.","translation":"サンプル内の年齢の分布を分析するために、ヒストグラムを作成しました。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"度数分布図"},{"sentence":"The shape of the **histogram** suggests a normal distribution.","translation":"ヒストグラムの形状は正規分布を示唆しています。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"度数分布図"}]}

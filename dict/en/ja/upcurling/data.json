It is not a commonly used word, so it is more likely to be found in descriptive writing or technical contexts where precise language is needed. The word is formed by combining \"up\" and \"curling,\" making its meaning relatively straightforward to understand. However, due to its infrequent usage, it is more suitable for advanced learners who are familiar with a wide range of vocabulary."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The artist carefully painted the upcurling waves of the ocean.","translation":"その芸術家は、注意深く海の上向きにカールした波を描いた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"形状"},{"sentence":"The smoke was upcurling from the chimney.","translation":"煙突から煙が巻き上がっていた。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"動き"}]}

In color theory, it means reducing the intensity or purity of a color, making it look more gray. In medicine, it refers to a decrease in the oxygen level in the blood. Because it's a technical term, it's more common in specialized contexts and less common in everyday conversation. You'll likely encounter it in discussions about image editing, art, or medical conditions.

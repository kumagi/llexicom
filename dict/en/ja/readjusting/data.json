It's used when circumstances change, and a new adjustment is necessary. For example, after moving to a new city, you might need to 'readjust' to a different climate, culture, or lifestyle. It's not as common as 'adjust', but it's useful in situations where a second or subsequent adjustment is required.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The astronaut is readjusting to Earth's gravity after spending months in space.","translation":"宇宙飛行士は、宇宙で数ヶ月過ごした後、地球の重力に再び適応しています。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"adapting to new conditions"},{"sentence":"The therapist helped her readjust her thinking patterns after the traumatic event.","translation":"セラピストは、彼女がトラウマとなる出来事の後、思考パターンを再調整するのを助けました。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"modifying"},{"sentence":"The company is readjusting its financial forecasts due to the changing economic climate.","translation":"会社は、変化する経済状況により、財務予測を再調整しています。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"revising"},{"sentence":"After the software update, users may need to readjust their settings.","translation":"ソフトウェアのアップデート後、ユーザーは設定を再調整する必要があるかもしれません。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"reconfiguring"},{"sentence":"He spent the first few weeks readjusting his sleep schedule after returning from his trip.","translation":"彼は旅行から帰国後、最初の数週間を睡眠スケジュールを再調整することに費やしました。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"adapting"}]}

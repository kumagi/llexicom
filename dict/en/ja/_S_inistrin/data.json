Its main application is as a marker to measure the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), which is a key indicator of kidney function. Because it is freely filtered by the glomeruli (filtering units in the kidneys) and is neither secreted nor reabsorbed by the renal tubules, its rate of clearance from the blood accurately reflects the GFR. It is considered a more accurate marker than creatinine in certain situations.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Sinistrin is a type of protein.","correct":"✓ Sinistrin is a type of fructan (polysaccharide).","note":"Sinistrin is a carbohydrate, specifically a fructan, not a protein."},{"incorrect":"✗ Sinistrin is absorbed by the kidneys.","correct":"✓ Sinistrin is filtered but not absorbed by the kidneys.","note":"Sinistrin is filtered by the glomeruli but is not reabsorbed by the renal tubules.

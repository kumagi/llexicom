Hydrocarbons are molecules made of hydrogen and carbon atoms. Alkanes are 'saturated' hydrocarbons, which means that all the carbon atoms are connected by single bonds, and each carbon atom is bonded to the maximum number of hydrogen atoms possible. This makes them relatively stable and unreactive. Examples of alkanes include methane (natural gas) and propane (used in gas grills). The term is mainly used in scientific and technical contexts.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The properties of an alkane depend on the number of carbon atoms in its structure.","translation":"アルカンの特性は、その構造中の炭素原子の数に依存する。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"chemical compound"},{"sentence":"Crude oil is a complex mixture of various alkanes and other hydrocarbons.","translation":"原油は、様々なアルカンや他の炭化水素の複雑な混合物である。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"chemical compound"},{"sentence":"Cycloalkanes are alkanes that contain a ring of carbon atoms.","translation":"シクロアルカンは、炭素原子の環を含むアルカンである。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"chemical compound"}]}

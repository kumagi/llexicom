High iconicity means a strong resemblance, making the sign easier to understand. For example, an onomatopoeic word like 'buzz' has high iconicity because its sound resembles the sound it represents. Conversely, a completely arbitrary symbol has low iconicity. The concept is important in semiotics, linguistics, and design.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The iconicity of the painting was very beauty.","correct":"✓ The iconicity of the painting was very high. / ✓ The painting had a high degree of iconicity.","note":"Iconicity is a quality or degree, not a characteristic that can be 'beauty'.

If something has high iconicity, it's easy to see the connection between the sign and what it means. For instance, a picture of a cat has high iconicity because it looks like a cat. A word like 'meow' also has iconicity because it sounds like a cat.

Because it's formed by adding the prefix \"un-\" to \"safely,\" it's relatively easy to understand if you know the meaning of \"safely.\" You'll typically find it used in contexts where someone is doing something that puts themselves or others at risk. For example, \"He was driving **unsafely** because he was texting.\" The word is not as common as \"unsafe\" or \"safely,\" so it's more likely to appear in formal writing or situations where precise language is important."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The construction workers were working **unsafely** without helmets.","translation":"建設作業員はヘルメットなしで危険な作業をしていた。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"危険な方法で"},{"sentence":"The old wiring was installed **unsafely**, creating a fire hazard.","translation":"古い配線は安全でない方法で設置されており、火災の危険性があった。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"安全でないやり方で"},{"sentence":"He lifted the heavy box **unsafely**, straining his back.","translation":"彼は重い箱を危険な方法で持ち上げ、背中を痛めた。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"危険な方法で"}]}

These cells are unique because they possess flagella, which allow them to swim and move through water. This motility is crucial for their survival as it enables them to find suitable environments for growth and reproduction. They are primarily involved in asexual reproduction, meaning they can create new organisms without the need for genetic exchange with another cell. The term is mainly used in the context of biology, mycology, and related scientific fields."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The potato late blight pathogen *Phytophthora infestans* spreads via **zoospores** in wet conditions.","translation":"ジャガイモ疫病菌である *Phytophthora infestans* は、湿潤な条件下で遊走子を介して広がります。","type":"general","meaning_category":"biology"},{"sentence":"Chytrid fungi release **zoospores** into the water to infect new hosts.","translation":"ツボカビは、新しい宿主に感染するために遊走子を水中に放出します。","type":"general","meaning_category":"mycology"}]}

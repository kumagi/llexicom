They are diploid spores produced by the carposporophyte generation, which itself arises from the fertilization of the carpogonium (female reproductive structure) by a spermatia (male gamete). The carpospore germinates to form the tetrasporophyte, completing the triphasic life cycle.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Carpospores are haploid.","correct":"✓ Carpospores are diploid.","note":"Carpospores are diploid spores, resulting from fertilization."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["carposporophyte"],"phrasal_verbs":[]},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C2","text":"The term 'carpospore' is a technical term used in the context of red algae biology and is not commonly encountered outside of this specific field.

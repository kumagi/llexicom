It involves presenting different concentrations of odors to a subject and determining the lowest concentration at which the odor can be detected (odor threshold) or recognized. This technique is used in various fields, including medicine (to diagnose olfactory disorders), environmental science (to assess odor pollution), and food science (to evaluate food aromas).","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ osphresiometry test is pain.","correct":"✓ The osphresiometry test is painless.","note":"The osphresiometry test is non-invasive and does not cause pain."}],"priority":"★☆☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["osphresis (嗅覚)","olfactometer (嗅覚計)","anosmia (嗅覚喪失)","hyposmia (嗅覚低下)","hyperosmia (嗅覚過敏)"],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"frequency_google_ngram":"非常に低頻度 (Very low frequency) - 専門用語","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"Osphresiometry is a technical term referring to the quantitative measurement of the sense of smell.

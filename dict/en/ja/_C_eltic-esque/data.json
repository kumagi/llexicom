It implies an imitation or evocation of Celtic elements rather than being authentically Celtic. The word is formed by adding the suffix \"-esque\" to \"Celtic,\" which denotes a style or manner. Due to its specialized usage and relatively low frequency, it is more likely to be encountered by advanced learners or those with a specific interest in Celtic culture or art. Understanding the meaning of the suffix \"-esque\" is helpful in deciphering the word's meaning."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The band played a Celtic-esque tune on their fiddles.","translation":"そのバンドはフィドルでケルト風の曲を演奏した。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"ケルト風の音楽"},{"sentence":"The artist created a Celtic-esque design for the book cover.","translation":"そのアーティストは本の表紙にケルト風のデザインを作成した。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"ケルト風のデザイン"},{"sentence":"The restaurant had a Celtic-esque atmosphere, with traditional music and decor.","translation":"そのレストランは、伝統的な音楽と装飾でケルト風の雰囲気だった。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"ケルト風の雰囲気"}]}

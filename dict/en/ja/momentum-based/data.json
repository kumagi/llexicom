It describes systems or strategies that incorporate the concept of momentum, where past actions or trends influence future behavior or decisions. In finance, it refers to investment strategies that buy assets that have recently performed well and sell assets that have recently performed poorly. In machine learning, momentum is used in optimization algorithms to accelerate learning and avoid getting stuck in local minima.

Momentum, in this context, refers to the tendency of a system to continue in its current direction or state due to inertia or accumulated force. For example, in finance, a momentum-based investing strategy involves buying assets that have recently increased in price, under the assumption that they will continue to rise. In machine learning, momentum-based optimization algorithms use past updates to accelerate learning and avoid getting stuck in local optima.

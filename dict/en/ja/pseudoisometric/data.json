In true isometric projection, all three axes are equally foreshortened, resulting in angles of 120 degrees between them. Pseudoisometric projections often deviate slightly from these angles to achieve a more visually appealing or computationally efficient result. They are commonly used in video games, computer graphics, and technical illustrations where a realistic 3D appearance is desired but precise measurements are not critical.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The image is isometric, but not quite.

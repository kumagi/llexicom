It's often done to simplify the design, reduce costs, or improve reliability. The word is formed by adding the prefix 'de-' to 'electronify,' indicating the reversal of the process of adding electronics. This term is not commonly used in everyday language and is more likely to be found in engineering or technical contexts."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The goal was to de-electronify the assembly line, replacing complex circuits with simpler mechanical solutions.","translation":"目標は、複雑な回路をより単純な機械的ソリューションに置き換えることで、組立ラインから電子部品を減らすことだった。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"remove electronics"},{"sentence":"By de-electronifying the control panel, we significantly lowered the risk of electrical failures.","translation":"制御盤から電子部品を減らすことで、電気的故障のリスクを大幅に下げることができた。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"reduce electronics"}]}

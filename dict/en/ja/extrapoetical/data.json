It is primarily used in literary criticism and academic discussions related to poetry. Understanding the word requires familiarity with the concept of poetry and the ability to recognize elements that are outside the scope of poetic analysis. The prefix \"extra-\" indicates that something is beyond or outside of a particular domain, in this case, poetry. Therefore, \"extrapoetical\" refers to aspects or considerations that are not directly related to the artistic or aesthetic qualities of a poem itself."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The critic argued that extrapoetical factors, such as the author's biography, should not influence our interpretation of the poem.","translation":"批評家は、作者の伝記のような詩的範囲外の要素は、詩の解釈に影響を与えるべきではないと主張した。","type":"general","meaning_category":"general"},{"sentence":"The study examines the extrapoetical dimensions of the work, focusing on its historical context and social impact.","translation":"その研究は、作品の詩的範囲外の側面を検証し、その歴史的背景と社会的影響に焦点を当てている。","type":"general","meaning_category":"general"}]}

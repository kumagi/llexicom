This distinguishes it from typical dentin found in mammalian teeth, which is avascular. Vasodentine is primarily found in the teeth of certain fish species and some other lower vertebrates. Its presence allows for direct vascularization of the dentin, potentially contributing to rapid tooth growth and repair.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[],"priority":"☆☆☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["dentine","dentin","odontoblast","vascular"],"phrasal_verbs":[]},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"N/A","frequency_google_ngram":"Low","priority":"☆☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C2","text":"Vasodentine is a highly specialized term in the field of vertebrate tooth morphology and histology.

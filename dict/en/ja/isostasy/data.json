It describes the state of gravitational equilibrium between the Earth's crust and mantle such that the crust 'floats' at an elevation that depends on its thickness and density. Think of it like icebergs floating in water: larger, thicker icebergs float higher. Isostatic adjustments occur when weight is added to or removed from the crust, leading to subsidence or uplift, respectively.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Isostasy is a type of rock.","correct":"✓ Isostasy is a state of equilibrium in the Earth's crust.","note":"Isostasy is not a physical substance like a rock, but rather a condition of balance.

Imagine the Earth's crust as different-sized blocks of wood floating on water. Larger, thicker blocks float higher than smaller, thinner blocks. This principle explains why mountains have deep 'roots' and why land rises after a large ice sheet melts.

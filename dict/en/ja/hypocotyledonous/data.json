The hypocotyl, which is the stem of the seedling below the cotyledons, elongates and pushes the epicotyl (the part of the stem above the cotyledons) above the soil surface. This is in contrast to epigeal germination, where the cotyledons are pushed above ground.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The plant is hypocotyledon.","correct":"✓ The plant is hypocotyledonous.","note":"'Hypocotyledon' is a noun referring to a plant exhibiting hypocotyledonous germination, but 'hypocotyledonous' is the adjective form describing the type of germination."}],"priority":"★☆☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["hypocotyl","epicotyl","cotyledon"],"related_terms":["epigeal","germination"],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"frequency_google_ngram":"Very low frequency.

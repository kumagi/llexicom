It is more common in plants than in animals and can lead to increased size, vigor, and novel traits.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The polyploid is when a cell has two chromosomes.","correct":"✓ Polyploidy is when a cell has more than two sets of chromosomes.","note":"Polyploidy refers to having more than *two sets* of chromosomes, not just two chromosomes.

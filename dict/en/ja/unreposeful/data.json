It's used to describe something that is not conducive to relaxation or tranquility. Because it's not a frequently used word, it's more likely to be encountered in formal writing or literature. It's formed by adding the prefix \"un-\" to \"reposeful,\" which means full of rest. Understanding the root word \"repose\" (to rest or lie down) helps in grasping the meaning of \"unreposeful.\" It's a more formal and nuanced way of saying \"restless\" or \"uneasy.\""},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The constant noise from the construction site made for an unreposeful night.","translation":"建設現場からの絶え間ない騒音は、落ち着きのない夜をもたらした。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"Lacking rest"},{"sentence":"His unreposeful spirit kept him searching for new adventures.","translation":"彼の落ち着きのない精神は、彼に新しい冒険を探し続けさせた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"Restless"},{"sentence":"The unreposeful sea tossed the small boat violently.","translation":"落ち着きのない海は、小さなボートを激しく揺さぶった。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"Disturbed"}]}

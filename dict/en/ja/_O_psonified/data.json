It describes the state of a particle (typically a bacterium or virus) that has been coated with opsonins (such as antibodies or complement proteins). This coating enhances the ability of phagocytes (like macrophages and neutrophils) to recognize, engulf, and destroy the particle. The term is most often encountered in scientific literature and medical contexts.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The cell was opsonified by itself.","correct":"✓ The cell was opsonified by complement proteins.","note":"Opsonization requires opsonins; it doesn't happen spontaneously."}],"priority":"★☆☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["opsonin (noun: オプソニン)","opsonization (noun: オプソニン化)","opsonize (verb: オプソニン化する)","opsonifying (verb: オプソニン化している)"],"priority":"★★★"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2 (specialized scientific vocabulary)","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency (専門的な用語)","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Opsonified' is a specialized term used in immunology.

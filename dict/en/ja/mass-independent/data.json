It describes processes or phenomena where the outcome is not solely determined by the mass of the isotopes involved. This is important because many natural processes, such as evaporation or diffusion, are mass-dependent, meaning that heavier isotopes behave differently from lighter isotopes.

It describes a process where the outcome doesn't depend on the mass of the isotopes involved. Isotopes are versions of an element with different numbers of neutrons, and in many processes, heavier isotopes behave differently than lighter ones. However, in mass-independent processes, this isn't the case, which can provide unique information about the conditions under which the process occurred.

It's often used in scientific research to describe experiments that are difficult or impossible to reproduce due to various factors. It can also be used in more general contexts to describe events or experiences that are unique and cannot be relived in the same way. The word is formed by adding the prefix 'un-' to 'repeatability', which means the ability to be repeated. Therefore, 'unrepeatability' is the opposite of 'repeatability'."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The **unrepeatability** of the chemical reaction made it difficult to study.","translation":"その化学反応の再現不可能性が、研究を困難にした。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"再現不可能性"},{"sentence":"The **unrepeatability** of historical events is what makes them so fascinating.","translation":"歴史的出来事の再現不可能性こそが、それらを非常に魅力的なものにしている。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"再現不可能性"},{"sentence":"The artist valued the **unrepeatability** of live performance.","translation":"アーティストはライブパフォーマンスの再現不可能性を重視した。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"再現不可能性"}]}

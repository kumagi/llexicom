It means that something (like a program, algorithm, or data structure) uses storage space (like a hard drive or memory) in a very effective way, without wasting space. It's often used when talking about ways to store a lot of information without using too much space. Understanding this term requires some familiarity with computer science concepts.","example_sentences":[{"sentence":"Using a storage-efficient format like JPEG can significantly reduce the size of image files.","translation":"JPEGのようなストレージ効率の良い形式を使用すると、画像ファイルのサイズを大幅に削減できます。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"memory usage"},{"sentence":"The database was redesigned to be more storage-efficient, saving the company money on server costs.","translation":"データベースは、よりストレージ効率が高くなるように再設計され、企業のサーバーコストを節約できました。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"memory usage"},{"sentence":"Cloud storage providers often offer storage-efficient solutions for archiving large amounts of data.","translation":"クラウドストレージプロバイダーは、大量のデータをアーカイブするためのストレージ効率の高いソリューションをよく提供しています。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"memory usage"}]}}

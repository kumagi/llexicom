All isotopes of a given element have the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons. The term 'isotopes' refers to the plural form; the singular form is 'isotope'. Isotopes have nearly identical chemical properties, but different physical properties, such as mass and radioactive decay rates. Radioactive isotopes are often used as tracers in various scientific and industrial applications.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The isotope are used in medicine.","correct":"✓ Isotopes are used in medicine.","note":"'Isotope' is singular, 'isotopes' is plural.

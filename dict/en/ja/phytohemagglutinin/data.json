It is particularly known for its ability to agglutinate red blood cells (hence 'hemagglutinin') and stimulate cell division, especially in lymphocytes. It is commonly used in cell culture and research settings.","priority":"☆☆☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ phytohemaglutinin","correct":"✓ phytohemagglutinin","note":"The correct spelling includes the double 'g' in 'agglutinin'."}],"priority":"☆☆☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["phytohaemagglutinin (alternative spelling)","lectin","agglutination"],"phrasal_verbs":[]},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Very low frequency","priority":"☆☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C2","text":"'Phytohemagglutinin' is a highly specialized term primarily used in scientific and medical contexts, specifically in cell biology, immunology, and biochemistry. It refers to a specific type of lectin with particular biological activities. Due to its technical nature, it is rarely encountered outside of these fields. Understanding requires familiarity with cell biology and protein chemistry."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The researchers used phytohemagglutinin to induce T-cell proliferation in vitro.","translation":"研究者たちは、試験管内でT細胞の増殖を誘導するために植物性赤血球凝集素を使用しました。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"赤血球凝集素"},{"sentence":"Phytohemagglutinin is extracted from beans and purified for use in laboratory experiments.","translation":"植物性赤血球凝集素は豆から抽出され、実験室での実験に使用するために精製されます。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"赤血球凝集素"}]}

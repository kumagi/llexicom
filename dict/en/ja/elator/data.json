They are typically long, thin cells with spiral thickenings in their walls. As the sporophyte dries out, the elators lose moisture and undergo rapid changes in shape, twisting and coiling. This movement helps to break up the spore mass and fling the individual spores into the air, facilitating their dispersal.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The elator is a type of seed.","correct":"✓ The elator helps disperse spores, not seeds.","note":"Elators are involved in spore dispersal, whereas seeds are a different reproductive structure in vascular plants."}],"priority":"★☆☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["elate (verb: to make someone ecstatically happy)","elation (noun: great happiness)"],"related_terms":["spore","sporophyte","liverwort","bryophyte","hornwort","horsetail"],"priority":"★☆☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"N/A (specialized botanical term)","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency (専門用語)","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C2","text":"'Elator' is a specialized botanical term referring to a structure that aids in spore dispersal in certain non-vascular plants like liverworts.

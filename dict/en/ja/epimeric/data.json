It describes molecules that are stereoisomers, meaning they have the same molecular formula and sequence of bonded atoms, but differ in the three-dimensional orientations of those atoms. 'Epimeric' specifies that the difference in spatial arrangement occurs at only *one* specific carbon atom (stereocenter) within the molecule. This term is most often encountered in advanced chemistry or biology contexts."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"Glucose and galactose are epimeric at carbon 4.","translation":"グルコースとガラクトースは4位の炭素でエピマーの関係にある。","type":"example","meaning_category":"chemical relationship"}]}

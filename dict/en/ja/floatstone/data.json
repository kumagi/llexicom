Understanding this term requires knowledge of basic geology and rock classification. The key feature is the presence of relatively large clasts (fragments) that are not in direct contact with each other, but rather 'float' within a finer-grained matrix. This distinguishes it from other types of sedimentary rocks where the clasts are touching or are of a different size.","priority":"★★★"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The geologist examined the floatstone sample under a microscope.","translation":"地質学者は顕微鏡で浮石のサンプルを調べた。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"浮石"},{"sentence":"The quarry contained a significant layer of floatstone.","translation":"その採石場には、浮石の重要な層が含まれていた。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"浮石"}]}

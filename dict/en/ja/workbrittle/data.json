This occurs when a metal is subjected to plastic deformation, typically through cold working, which increases its hardness but reduces its ductility, making it more susceptible to fracture. Understanding this term requires knowledge of metallurgy and materials processing techniques."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The copper wire became workbrittle after being drawn through the die multiple times.","translation":"その銅線は、ダイを通して何度も引き抜かれた後、加工硬化によって脆くなった。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"脆くなった"},{"sentence":"The blacksmith had to anneal the iron to prevent it from workbrittling.","translation":"鍛冶屋は鉄が加工硬化によって脆くなるのを防ぐために、焼きなましをする必要があった。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"脆くする"}]}

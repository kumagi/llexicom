It's used to describe a look or expression where the person's gaze seems to be directed inward or backward, suggesting deep thought, detachment, or a connection to the past. Because it combines two concepts (receding and gazing) into a single descriptive term, it requires a good understanding of figurative language and nuanced vocabulary.

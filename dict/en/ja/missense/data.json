It refers to a specific type of point mutation where a single nucleotide change results in a codon that specifies a different amino acid. This can affect the protein's structure and function. It is important to distinguish missense mutations from other types of mutations, such as nonsense mutations (which introduce a premature stop codon) and silent mutations (which do not change the amino acid sequence).","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The missense was a deletion of a base pair.","correct":"✓ The missense was a substitution of a base pair.","note":"Missense mutations are substitutions, not deletions or insertions.

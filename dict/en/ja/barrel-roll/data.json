It differs from an aileron roll, which is a faster, more axial roll. In a barrel-roll, the aircraft follows a helical path, making it distinct from a simple roll around its longitudinal axis.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ He did a barrel roll with his car.","correct":"✓ He rolled his car.","note":"While the term 'barrel roll' is sometimes used colloquially to describe a car rolling over, it's technically incorrect.

It involves the aircraft completing a full rotation while continuing along its original flight path, creating a corkscrew-like trajectory.

The term is primarily used in aviation and related contexts.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The pilot skillfully performed a barrel-roll to evade the missile.","translation":"パイロットはミサイルを回避するために巧みにバレルロールを行った。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"機動"},{"sentence":"The barrel-roll is a common maneuver in airshows.","translation":"バレルロールは航空ショーでよく見られる機動だ。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"機動"}]}

It can refer to physical movement, like a river's course, or to abstract concepts, like a conversation or a piece of writing. The word often implies a lack of urgency or purpose, suggesting a leisurely or aimless quality.

It's not a common word, so it's more likely to be found in advanced texts or when someone wants to use a more descriptive word than 'aimlessly' or 'indirectly'. Think of a river that doesn't flow straight but curves and bends a lot – that's how something described as 'meanderingly' moves or progresses."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The path led meanderingly through the dense forest.","translation":"道は鬱蒼とした森の中を曲がりくねって続いていた。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"曲がりくねって"},{"sentence":"He explained the project meanderingly, losing his audience along the way.","translation":"彼はそのプロジェクトをとりとめのなく説明し、途中で聴衆を飽きさせてしまった。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"とりとめのなく"},{"sentence":"The stream flowed meanderingly across the meadow.","translation":"小川は牧草地を蛇行しながら流れていた。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"曲がりくねって"}]}

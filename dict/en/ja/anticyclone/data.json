It is formed from the prefix \"anti-\" (meaning against or opposite) and \"cyclone\" (referring to a system of winds rotating around a center of low atmospheric pressure). Thus, an anticyclone is literally the opposite of a cyclone.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/ˌæntiˈsaɪkləʊn/","syllables":"an-ti-cy-clone"},"inflection":{"noun_plural":"anticyclones"},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"An \"anticyclone\" is a weather phenomenon characterized by high atmospheric pressure and descending air. This results in stable air conditions, clear skies, and light winds. In the Northern Hemisphere, air circulates clockwise around an anticyclone, while in the Southern Hemisphere, it circulates counterclockwise. Anticyclones can persist for several days or even weeks, influencing weather patterns over large areas. They are often associated with dry conditions and can lead to droughts if they remain stationary for extended periods.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The anticyclone caused a hurricane.","correct":"✓ The anticyclone brought calm weather.","note":"Anticyclones are associated with calm weather, while hurricanes are associated with cyclones (low-pressure systems)."},{"incorrect":"✗ Anticyclones rotate counterclockwise in the Northern Hemisphere.","correct":"✓ Anticyclones rotate clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere.","note":"In the Northern Hemisphere, anticyclones rotate clockwise, while cyclones rotate counterclockwise."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["anticyclonic (adjective: relating to or characteristic of an anticyclone)"],"related_terms":["cyclone","high pressure","atmospheric pressure","weather system","meteorology","isobar","ridge","trough"],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C1","frequency_google_ngram":"Relatively low frequency, mainly used in weather reports and scientific contexts.","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"An \"anticyclone\" is a weather term that refers to a high-pressure system in the atmosphere. Unlike cyclones (low-pressure systems), anticyclones are associated with stable weather conditions, such as clear skies and light winds. The air in an anticyclone descends, which inhibits cloud formation and precipitation. The word itself is formed by adding the prefix \"anti-\" (meaning opposite) to \"cyclone,\" indicating that it is the opposite type of weather system. This term is typically used in weather forecasts and meteorological discussions.","priority":"★★★"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The strong **anticyclone** is causing a heatwave across Europe.","translation":"強い高気圧がヨーロッパ全土で熱波を引き起こしている。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"weather system"},{"sentence":"The **anticyclone** over the UK is bringing dry and sunny weather.","translation":"イギリス上空の高気圧が乾燥した晴天をもたらしている。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"weather system"},{"sentence":"The movement of the **anticyclone** will determine the weather for the next few days.","translation":"高気圧の動きが今後数日間の天気を左右するだろう。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"weather system"}]}

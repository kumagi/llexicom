It implies a degree of involvement that is less than complete or wholehearted. This term is often used to indicate a moderate or partial level of activity, suggesting that there is some action taking place, but it is not as vigorous or committed as it could be.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The system is quasi actively working.","correct":"✓ The system is quasi-actively working.","note":"The hyphen is important to connect 'quasi-' to 'actively' to form a single adverb.

It is used to describe actions or involvement that are partial or moderate in nature. This word is relatively uncommon and is more likely to be encountered in formal or technical contexts where precise descriptions of activity levels are necessary. Understanding the prefix 'quasi-' is essential to grasping the meaning of this word, as it signifies a resemblance or approximation to the base word (in this case, 'active')."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The committee was quasi-actively reviewing the proposals, offering feedback but not making any immediate decisions.","translation":"委員会は提案を準活動的に検討しており、フィードバックは提供していますが、即座に決定を下しているわけではありません。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"Partially active"},{"sentence":"The software was quasi-actively monitoring the network traffic, logging potential threats but not automatically blocking them.","translation":"そのソフトウェアはネットワークトラフィックを準活動的に監視しており、潜在的な脅威を記録していますが、自動的にブロックしているわけではありません。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"Somewhat active"},{"sentence":"The volunteers were quasi-actively assisting with the event, helping with setup but not taking on any major responsibilities.","translation":"ボランティアはイベントを準活動的に支援しており、準備を手伝っていますが、主要な責任は負っていません。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"Nearly active"}]}

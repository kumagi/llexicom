It's like saying, 'If I get rid of two workers, how many machines do I need to buy to make up for it?' This idea is shown on a graph called an isoquant, and the MRTS is just the slope of that line. It's important for companies to understand this to make the most efficient choices about what to use to produce their goods or services."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The firm adjusted its production process to optimize the MRTS between labor and automation.","translation":"その企業は、労働と自動化の間の限界代替率を最適化するために、生産プロセスを調整しました。","type":"definition","meaning_category":"Economics"},{"sentence":"A high MRTS suggests that the company has flexibility in choosing its input mix.","translation":"高い限界代替率は、企業が投入要素の組み合わせを選択する際に柔軟性があることを示唆しています。","type":"definition","meaning_category":"Economics"}]}

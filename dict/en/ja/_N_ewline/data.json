Different operating systems use different conventions for representing newlines: Unix-like systems (including Linux and macOS) use a single Line Feed (LF) character (`\n`), while Windows uses a Carriage Return followed by a Line Feed (CRLF) (`\r\n`).

It's like pressing the 'Enter' key on your keyboard. Different computer systems use different ways to represent this 'new line' instruction.

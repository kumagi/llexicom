It describes a material, such as an alloy or metal, that cannot be hardened through heat treatment processes like tempering. Tempering involves controlled heating and cooling to achieve desired mechanical properties. If a material is described as \"nontemperable\", it means that this process will not significantly alter its hardness or strength. Understanding this term requires familiarity with materials science concepts and vocabulary."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"Aluminum alloys in the 5000 series are generally considered to be nontemperable.","translation":"5000系のアルミニウム合金は一般的に焼き入れ硬化しないと考えられています。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"material property"},{"sentence":"The blacksmith knew that this particular type of iron was nontemperable, so he used a different technique to strengthen it.","translation":"鍛冶屋はその特定の種類の鉄が焼き戻しできないことを知っていたので、それを強化するために別の技術を使用しました。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"material property"}]}

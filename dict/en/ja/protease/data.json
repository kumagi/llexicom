They are essential for various biological processes, including digestion, blood clotting, immune response, and programmed cell death (apoptosis). Different types of proteases exist, classified based on their catalytic mechanism (e.g., serine proteases, metalloproteases). Protease inhibitors are drugs that block the activity of proteases and are used in the treatment of diseases such as HIV infection.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Protease is a type of protein.","correct":"✓ Protease is a type of enzyme.","note":"Proteases are enzymes, not proteins, although they act on proteins."},{"incorrect":"✗ Proteases are only found in animals.","correct":"✓ Proteases are found in animals, plants, and microorganisms.","note":"Proteases are ubiquitous and found in all living organisms."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["proteolytic (adjective: relating to or promoting the breakdown of proteins)","proteolysis (noun: the breakdown of proteins or peptides into amino acids and other simple compounds)"],"phrasal_verbs":[],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C1","frequency_google_ngram":"Relatively low frequency, primarily used in scientific contexts.","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Protease' is a technical term primarily used in biology, biochemistry, and medicine.

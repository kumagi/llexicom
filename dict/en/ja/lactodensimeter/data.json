It is floated in a milk sample, and the point at which the surface of the milk intersects the calibrated scale on the stem of the instrument indicates the specific gravity of the milk. This measurement can help detect adulteration, such as the addition of water.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The lactodensimeter measures the fat content directly.","correct":"✓ The lactodensimeter measures the specific gravity, which can indicate fat content indirectly.","note":"A lactodensimeter measures specific gravity, not fat content directly.

It means turning something that can have any value (continuous) into something that can only have specific, separate values (discrete). Think of it like this: instead of a smooth ramp, you have stairs. In signal processing, it's how analog sounds become digital. In physics, it's how energy levels in atoms are restricted to certain amounts. It's a key concept for understanding how computers handle real-world information and how the universe works at a very small scale."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The **quantization** of the audio signal resulted in a loss of subtle details.","translation":"オーディオ信号の量子化により、微妙なディテールが失われました。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"信号処理"},{"sentence":"The **quantization** of energy levels in atoms is a cornerstone of quantum mechanics.","translation":"原子内のエネルギー準位の量子化は、量子力学の基礎です。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"物理学"},{"sentence":"Careful **quantization** is needed to minimize distortion in digital images.","translation":"デジタル画像における歪みを最小限に抑えるには、慎重な量子化が必要です。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"信号処理"},{"sentence":"The **quantization** process maps continuous values to a discrete set.","translation":"量子化プロセスは、連続値を離散的な集合にマッピングします。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"一般的な定義"}]}

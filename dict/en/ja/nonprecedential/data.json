It describes a court decision that does not establish a binding precedent. This means that lower courts are not required to follow the ruling in future cases, and the decision cannot be cited as authoritative legal support. Such decisions are often unpublished and are typically reserved for cases with straightforward legal issues or those that do not significantly contribute to the development of legal principles.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The judge made a non-precedent decision.","correct":"✓ The judge made a nonprecedential decision.","note":"The correct term is \"nonprecedential,\" not \"non-precedent.\""},{"incorrect":"✗ This case is non-precedential, so it must be wrong.","correct":"✓ This case is nonprecedential, so it cannot be cited as a binding precedent.","note":"A nonprecedential decision is not necessarily incorrect; it simply lacks binding authority in future cases."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["precedent (名詞: 先例、判例)","precedential (形容詞: 先例となる、判例としての)"],"related_terms":["stare decisis (判例拘束性の原則)","binding precedent (拘束力のある先例)","persuasive authority (説得力のある権威)"],"priority":"★★★"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"低頻度 (Low frequency) - 専門用語","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C2","text":"The term \"**nonprecedential**\" is a legal term indicating that a court ruling does not establish a binding precedent.

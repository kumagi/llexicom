They use various techniques, including radiometric dating methods (such as uranium-lead, potassium-argon, and carbon-14 dating), to establish a timeline of Earth's history. Their work is essential for understanding the timing of major geological processes, such as mountain building, volcanic activity, and the evolution of life.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ He is a geochronology.","correct":"✓ He is a geochronologist.","note":"'Geochronology' is the field of study, while 'geochronologist' is the person who studies it."},{"incorrect":"✗ Geochronologists study only rocks.","correct":"✓ Geochronologists study rocks, minerals, and geological events.","note":"Geochronologists study a wide range of materials and events to determine their age."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["geochronology (年代学、地球年代学)","geochronologic (年代学的な、地球年代学的な)"],"related_fields":["geology (地質学)","geophysics (地球物理学)","cosmochemistry (宇宙化学)","paleontology (古生物学)","archeology (考古学)"],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency.

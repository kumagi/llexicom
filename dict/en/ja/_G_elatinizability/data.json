It refers to the capacity of a substance, typically starch, to undergo gelatinization – a process where it absorbs water and swells when heated, forming a gel-like consistency. Due to its specialized nature, it is unlikely to be encountered outside of academic or professional contexts dealing with these subjects."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The gelatinizability of the modified starch was significantly improved compared to the native starch.","translation":"改質デンプンのゼラチン化能は、天然デンプンと比較して大幅に改善されました。","type":"general","meaning_category":"ゼラチン化能"}]}

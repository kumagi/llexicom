It also applies in biology to describe organisms that can thrive in the absence of sunlight, such as certain types of bacteria or algae.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The plant is sun-independent, so it needs direct sunlight.","correct":"✓ The plant is sun-dependent, so it needs direct sunlight.","note":"'Sun-independent' means it *doesn't* need sunlight, while 'sun-dependent' means it *does* need sunlight.

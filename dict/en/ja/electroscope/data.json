It typically consists of two thin metal leaves (often gold) suspended from an electrode. When a charged object is brought near the electrode, the leaves repel each other due to induced charge, indicating the presence of charge. The degree of separation of the leaves is proportional to the amount of charge.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ He used a microscope to detect the electric charge.","correct":"✓ He used an electroscope to detect the electric charge.","note":"A microscope is for viewing small objects, while an electroscope is for detecting electric charge."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["electroscopic (adjective)"],"phrasal_verbs":[],"related_concepts":["static electricity","electric charge","induction","capacitance"]},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C1","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency - Primarily used in scientific contexts.","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"An electroscope is a scientific tool used to find out if something has an electrical charge. It works by having two thin pieces of metal that move apart when a charged object is nearby. The further apart they move, the more charge there is. It's mainly used in science education and experiments about electricity.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The teacher showed the class how to use an electroscope to test different materials for static electricity.","translation":"先生は、静電気についてさまざまな材料をテストするために検電器を使用する方法をクラスに示しました。","type":"example","meaning_category":"usage"},{"sentence":"The gold-leaf electroscope is a sensitive instrument for detecting small amounts of electric charge.","translation":"箔検電器は、少量の電荷を検出するための高感度な機器です。","type":"example","meaning_category":"description"},{"sentence":"By touching a charged rod to the electroscope, the leaves spread apart, indicating the presence of charge.","translation":"帯電した棒を検電器に接触させることで、箔が広がり、電荷の存在を示します。","type":"example","meaning_category":"operation"}]}

They are used to track contextual information that influences a computation, such as resource usage, security constraints, or data dependencies. Unlike traditional side effects, which modify global state, coeffects describe the environment in which a computation takes place.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The program has many sidecoeffects.","correct":"✓ The program has many coeffects.","note":"The term is 'coeffects', not 'sidecoeffects'."}],"priority":"★★★"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["coeffect (singular noun)"],"related_concepts":["effect system","type theory","functional programming","linear logic"],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency - Specialized term in computer science.","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Coeffects' is a technical term used in advanced programming and type theory. It refers to a way of tracking how the context of a computation (like resource usage or security) affects the computation itself. It's a complex concept often discussed in academic papers and specialized programming communities. Understanding coeffects requires a solid foundation in type systems and functional programming principles."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The use of **coeffects** allows the compiler to optimize resource allocation.","translation":"コエフェクトを使用すると、コンパイラはリソース割り当てを最適化できます。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"programming concept"},{"sentence":"**Coeffects** provide a more fine-grained control over the execution environment.","translation":"コエフェクトは、実行環境をより細かく制御できます。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"programming concept"}]}

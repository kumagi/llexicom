It's formed by adding '-ly' to the adjective 'fatheaded', which itself means 'stupid' or 'foolish'. This word is not very common in everyday language and is more likely to be found in literature or more formal writing. It's used to describe actions that are done without much thought or intelligence. Because of its relative rarity and the somewhat negative connotation, it's more likely to be encountered by advanced English learners."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"He fatheadedly invested all his money in a risky venture.","translation":"彼は愚かにも全財産を危険な事業に投資した。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"foolishly"},{"sentence":"She fatheadedly believed everything the con artist told her.","translation":"彼女はばか正直に詐欺師の言うことをすべて信じてしまった。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"naively"},{"sentence":"They fatheadedly ignored the warning signs and proceeded with the plan.","translation":"彼らは愚かにも警告サインを無視して計画を進めた。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"unwisely"}]}

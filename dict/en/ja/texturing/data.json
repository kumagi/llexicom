In art and design, it can refer to creating the illusion of texture in a painting or drawing. In 3D modeling and computer graphics, it involves applying images or procedural textures to the surface of a 3D model to give it a more realistic or detailed appearance. In construction and interior design, it can refer to applying textured finishes to walls or other surfaces.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The texturing was very texture.","correct":"✓ The texturing was very detailed.","note":"Avoid using \"texture\" as an adjective to describe texturing.

It's often used in art, design, and computer graphics to make things look more realistic or interesting. Think of it as adding details that you can see or feel on a surface.

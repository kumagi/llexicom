It's often used in business contexts to describe managers who are too involved in the details of their employees' work. This can be harmful because it reduces employees' autonomy and can lead to decreased productivity and morale. The word is formed by adding the prefix \"over-\" to \"managing,\" indicating an excess of management. It's a relatively sophisticated term, so it's more likely to be found in professional or academic writing.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The consultant warned against overmanaging the sales team.","translation":"コンサルタントは営業チームを過剰に管理することに警告した。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"過剰に管理する"},{"sentence":"The company's culture of overmanaging stifled creativity.","translation":"その会社の過剰な管理の文化は創造性を抑圧した。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"過剰な管理"},{"sentence":"She realized she was overmanaging and started delegating more tasks.","translation":"彼女は自分が過剰に管理していることに気づき、より多くのタスクを委任し始めた。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"過剰に管理する"},{"sentence":"The negative effects of overmanaging included high employee turnover.","translation":"過剰な管理の悪影響には、従業員の高い離職率が含まれていた。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"過剰な管理"}]}

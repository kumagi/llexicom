It's most often encountered in academic papers, statistical reports, or medical studies when researchers need to specifically differentiate this group from centenarians (people aged 100 or older). Because it's a somewhat complex and specialized term, it is not commonly used in everyday conversation. Instead, simpler phrases like 'under 100 years old' or 'younger people' are preferred in general contexts."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The study compared the cognitive functions of centenarians and non-centenarians.","translation":"その研究では、100歳以上の人と100歳未満の人の認知機能を比較した。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"person under 100"},{"sentence":"Non-centenarian adults were included in the survey.","translation":"100歳未満の成人が調査に含まれた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"under 100 years old"}]}

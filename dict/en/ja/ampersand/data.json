It arose from the practice of reciting the alphabet, where letters that could also be words (like 'A' and 'I') were followed by the Latin phrase 'per se' ('by itself') to indicate the letter itself, not the word it formed. Since '&' was often the last character in such recitations, it became 'and per se and', which was eventually slurred into 'ampersand'.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"ˈæmpərˌsænd","syllables":"am-per-sand"},"inflection":{"noun_plural":"ampersands"},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"The ampersand (&) is a logogram, a single symbol representing a word.

It's primarily used to save space or create a more stylized appearance, especially in titles, company names, and informal writing. While it's a recognizable symbol, its use is generally discouraged in formal writing where spelling out 'and' is preferred. The word itself has an interesting etymology, originating from a recitation practice where the symbol was referred to as 'and per se and', which evolved into 'ampersand' over time."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The law firm's name was Miller & Zois.","translation":"その法律事務所の名前はミラー＆ゾイスでした。","type":"example","meaning_category":"Name"},{"sentence":"Use an ampersand in your citation if the source has multiple authors.","translation":"情報源に複数の著者がいる場合は、引用にアンパサンドを使用してください。","type":"example","meaning_category":"Citation"},{"sentence":"The ampersand is a useful symbol for saving space.","translation":"アンパサンドはスペースを節約するのに便利な記号です。","type":"example","meaning_category":"Symbol"}]}

'Commissioning' itself refers to the process of bringing a system or equipment into operation for the first time. Therefore, 'recommissioning' means to commission again, or to restore to operational status.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/ˌriːkəˈmɪʃənɪŋ/","syllables":"re-com-mis-sion-ing"},"inflection":{"noun_plural":"recommissionings","verb_forms":{"present_simple":["recommissioning","recommissions"],"past_simple":"recommissioned","past_participle":"recommissioned","present_participle":"recommissioning"}},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Recommissioning' is often used in the context of engineering, energy management, and facilities management.

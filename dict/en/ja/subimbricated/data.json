Imbrication refers to a fabric where the clasts are aligned in a preferred direction, often indicating the direction of flow of the depositing current. 'Subimbricated' indicates that this alignment is not perfect, but that there is a tendency for the clasts to overlap in a consistent manner.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{},"related_words":{"derivatives":["imbricate","imbrication"],"phrasal_verbs":[]},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"N/A","frequency_google_ngram":"Very low frequency.","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C2","text":"The word 'subimbricated' is a technical term used in geology. It describes a specific arrangement of rocks or sediments where they partially overlap, similar to how tiles are arranged on a roof. The prefix 'sub-' indicates that the overlapping is not complete or perfect. This term is typically encountered in advanced geological texts or research papers.

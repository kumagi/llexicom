However, it is usually very weak and is only observable when other magnetic effects (such as paramagnetism or ferromagnetism) are absent. Diamagnetic materials are repelled by a magnetic field; an applied magnetic field creates an induced magnetic field in them in the opposite direction, causing a repulsive force.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{},"related_words":{"derivatives":["diamagnetically","diamagnetism"],"related_terms":["paramagnetic","ferromagnetic","magnetic susceptibility","magnetic field"],"priority":"★★★"},"level_frequency":{},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Diamagnetic' refers to a material that is repelled by a magnetic field.

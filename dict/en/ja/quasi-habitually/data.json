It suggests a strong tendency or frequent occurrence, but with the understanding that the action may not be performed every single time the opportunity arises. It is often used to describe behaviors that are developing into habits or that are performed very frequently but without conscious effort.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ He quasi-habitually eats breakfast every morning without fail.","correct":"✓ He habitually eats breakfast every morning without fail.","note":"If the action is performed without fail, \"habitually\" is more appropriate than \"quasi-habitually.\""},{"incorrect":"✗ She quasi habitually went to the gym once a month.","correct":"✓ She occasionally went to the gym.","note":"If the action is only performed once a month, \"occasionally\" is more appropriate than \"quasi-habitually.\""}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["quasi (adverb, adjective): ほとんど、～のような","habitually (adverb): 習慣的に","habit (noun): 習慣","quasi-judicial (adjective): 準司法的な","quasi-scientific (adjective): 準科学的な"],"phrases":["quasi-contract (準契約)","quasi-public (準公共の)"],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency.","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"The word \"quasi-habitually\" is a somewhat uncommon adverb that means \"almost habitually\" or \"nearly habitually.\" It describes an action that is repeated frequently, but not quite to the point of being a fully formed habit. It is used to indicate that something happens with a regularity approaching that of a habit, but without the same degree of unconsciousness or automaticity. Because it is a relatively rare and complex word, it is more likely to be encountered in formal writing or academic contexts.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The cat would quasi-habitually nap in the sunbeam on the windowsill.","translation":"その猫はほとんど習慣的に窓枠の日当たりの良い場所で昼寝をした。","type":"general"},{"sentence":"The software developer would quasi-habitually check the error logs first thing in the morning.","translation":"そのソフトウェア開発者はほとんど習慣的に朝一番にエラーログをチェックした。","type":"professional"},{"sentence":"The security guard quasi-habitually patrolled the perimeter fence every hour.","translation":"その警備員はほとんど習慣的に毎時間、境界フェンスを巡回した。","type":"professional"},{"sentence":"The student quasi-habitually doodled in the margins of her notebook during lectures.","translation":"その学生は講義中、ほとんど習慣的にノートの余白に落書きをした。","type":"academic"}]}

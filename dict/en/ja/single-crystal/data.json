It refers to a solid material in which the crystal lattice of the entire sample is continuous and unbroken to the edges of the sample, with no grain boundaries. Single crystals are often desired for specific applications due to their anisotropic properties and lack of scattering from grain boundaries.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ A single crystal material.","correct":"✓ A single-crystal material.","note":"The hyphen is important when using 'single-crystal' as a compound adjective."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["single-crystallinity"],"related_terms":["crystal","crystallography","grain boundary","lattice","monocrystalline","polycrystalline"]},"level_frequency":{"level":"C1","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency, technical term.","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Single-crystal' refers to a material where the entire solid is one continuous crystal. Imagine a perfectly organized arrangement of atoms extending throughout the whole object, without any interruptions or mismatched sections. This is important in fields like electronics because single crystals have very predictable and uniform properties, unlike materials made of many small crystals joined together (polycrystals)."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The efficiency of the solar cell was improved by using a single-crystal substrate.","translation":"太陽電池の効率は、単結晶基板を使用することで向上しました。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"material science"},{"sentence":"The properties of the single-crystal were investigated using neutron diffraction.","translation":"単結晶の特性は、中性子回折を用いて調査されました。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"material science"}]}

It refers to a process where a metal component is subjected to high internal pressure, causing the inner layers to plastically deform. This creates residual compressive stresses, which enhance the component's resistance to fatigue and fracture. The term is primarily encountered in specialized contexts related to high-pressure applications, such as gun barrels and hydraulic cylinders.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The **autofrettage** process significantly extends the lifespan of the pressure vessel.","translation":"自己締付け処理は圧力容器の寿命を大幅に延ばす。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"自己締付け処理"},{"sentence":"Proper **autofrettage** is crucial for the safe operation of high-pressure hydraulic systems.","translation":"適切な自己締付け処理は、高圧油圧システムの安全な運転に不可欠である。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"自己締付け処理"},{"sentence":"The **autofrettage** pressure must be carefully controlled to avoid over-stressing the material.","translation":"材料の過剰な応力を避けるために、自己締付け処理の圧力は慎重に制御する必要がある。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"自己締付け処理"}]}

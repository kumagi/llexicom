'Average' comes from the Old French word 'average', referring to a maritime term for loss or damage to goods or a ship. Over time, it came to mean a fair share of such loss, and then a typical or normal amount. The adverbial form 'averagely' thus describes something done or existing in a typical or normal manner.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/ˈævərɪdʒli/","syllables":"av-er-age-ly"},"inflection":{"notes":"As an adverb, 'averagely' does not have different forms for tense or number. It modifies verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs to indicate an average or moderate degree."},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Averagely' is an adverb that describes something done or existing in an average or typical manner. It can also mean 'moderately' or 'to a fair extent'. While grammatically correct, it is less commonly used than other adverbs like 'typically', 'normally', 'moderately', or 'fairly'. It is more frequently used in technical or statistical contexts to describe a result or measurement that is close to the average value. In everyday conversation, it might sound slightly formal or awkward, and a more common synonym might be preferred.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ She performed very averagely on the exam.","correct":"✓ She performed averagely on the exam. / ✓ She performed at an average level on the exam.","note":"Using 'very' with 'averagely' is redundant because 'averagely' already implies a moderate or typical level. It's better to use 'averagely' alone or rephrase the sentence.

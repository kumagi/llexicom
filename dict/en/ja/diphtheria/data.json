It is caused by the bacterium Corynebacterium diphtheriae, which produces a toxin that damages tissues in the throat and other organs. The hallmark of diphtheria is the formation of a thick, grayish membrane (pseudomembrane) in the throat, which can obstruct breathing. Vaccination against diphtheria is highly effective and is typically administered as part of routine childhood immunizations (e.g., DTaP vaccine). While diphtheria is now rare in many developed countries due to widespread vaccination, it remains a public health concern in some parts of the world.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ I have diptheria.","correct":"✓ I have diphtheria.","note":"The correct spelling is 'diphtheria' with a 'th' rather than 'p'."},{"incorrect":"✗ Diptheria is caused by a virus.","correct":"✓ Diphtheria is caused by a bacterium.","note":"Diphtheria is caused by the bacterium Corynebacterium diphtheriae, not a virus."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["diphtheritic (adjective: relating to or affected by diphtheria)"],"related_diseases":["tonsillitis","pharyngitis","croup"],"vaccines":["DTaP vaccine","Tdap vaccine","DT vaccine","Td vaccine"],"medical_specialties":["pediatrics","infectious disease","otolaryngology (ENT)"],"priority":"★★★"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C1 (医学・科学分野)","frequency_google_ngram":"比較的低い (Relatively low) - 医学用語のため、一般語彙としては頻度は低い。","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Diphtheria' is a technical term referring to a specific infectious disease.

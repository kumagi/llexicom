It is essentially impermeable, meaning water cannot pass through it easily. This term is typically used in the context of hydrogeology and groundwater management. Understanding aquicludes is crucial for understanding how groundwater systems work. It is important to note that an aquiclude differs from an aquifer, which is a layer of rock or sediment that can store and transmit groundwater.","priority":"★★★"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The clay layer acted as an aquiclude, preventing the downward movement of water.","translation":"その粘土層は難透水層として機能し、水の下方への移動を妨げた。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"難透水層"},{"sentence":"The presence of an aquiclude can significantly impact groundwater recharge rates.","translation":"難透水層の存在は、地下水の涵養率に大きな影響を与える可能性がある。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"難透水層"}]}

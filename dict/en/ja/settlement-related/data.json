A 'settlement' can mean a few things: a formal agreement to end a disagreement (like in a lawsuit), the act of resolving a problem, or the establishment of a new community. So, 'settlement-related' describes things that are connected to any of those ideas.

It's a more advanced term, so you'll typically find it in formal writing or discussions about law, politics, or history."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The report analyzed settlement-related environmental impacts.","translation":"その報告書は、入植に関連する環境への影響を分析した。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"入植に関連した"},{"sentence":"The judge reviewed all settlement-related documents before approving the agreement.","translation":"裁判官は合意を承認する前に、和解に関連するすべての書類を見直した。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"和解に関連した"},{"sentence":"Negotiations focused on settlement-related financial compensation.","translation":"交渉は、和解に関連する金銭的補償に焦点を当てた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"和解に関連した"}]}

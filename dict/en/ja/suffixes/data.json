Suffixes are essential for creating new words and modifying existing ones. They can indicate tense (e.g., '-ed' for past tense), number (e.g., '-s' for plural), degree (e.g., '-est' for superlative), or part of speech (e.g., '-ly' to form adverbs). There are two main types of suffixes: derivational and inflectional. Derivational suffixes create new words, while inflectional suffixes modify a word's grammatical function without changing its core meaning.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ I added a prefixes to the word.","correct":"✓ I added a suffix to the word.","note":"'Suffix' is added at the end of a word, while 'prefix' is added at the beginning."},{"incorrect":"✗ The suffix change the word's meaning.","correct":"✓ The suffix changes the word's meaning.","note":"The subject 'suffix' is singular, so the verb should be 'changes'."},{"incorrect":"✗ -ing is a suffixing.","correct":"✓ -ing is a suffix.","note":"'Suffixing' is the act of adding a suffix, while '-ing' itself is a suffix."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["suffixation (名詞: 接尾辞を付けること)","suffixal (形容詞: 接尾辞の)"],"phrases":["derivational suffix (派生接尾辞)","inflectional suffix (屈折接尾辞)"],"priority":"★★★"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"B2","frequency_google_ngram":"Relatively low frequency, primarily used in academic or linguistic contexts.","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"The term \"suffixes\" refers to word endings that alter a word's meaning or grammatical function.

It results in distinct soil horizons, including a bleached, ashy-gray layer near the surface and an accumulation of iron and aluminum oxides in deeper layers. The process is driven by the acidic decomposition of organic matter, which mobilizes iron and aluminum.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Podzolization occurs in tropical climates.","correct":"✓ Podzolization occurs in cool, humid climates.","note":"Podzolization is characteristic of cool, humid climates, not tropical climates."},{"incorrect":"✗ Podzolization increases soil fertility.","correct":"✓ Podzolization decreases soil fertility.","note":"Podzolization typically leads to decreased soil fertility due to the leaching of nutrients."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["podzol","podzolic","podzolized"],"related_terms":["eluviation","illuviation","leaching","soil horizon","soil profile"],"priority":"★★★"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C1-C2 (specialized vocabulary)","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency (scientific context)","priority":"★★☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Podzolization' is a technical term used in soil science and geography to describe a specific process of soil formation.

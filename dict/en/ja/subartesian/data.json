It describes water trapped in an aquifer under pressure, similar to artesian water, but with a crucial difference: the pressure is not high enough to force the water to the surface naturally. Therefore, a pump is required to extract the water. The term is often used in hydrogeology and water resource management.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The water flows freely from the subartesian well.","correct":"✓ The water needs to be pumped from the subartesian well.","note":"Subartesian wells require pumping because the water doesn't flow naturally to the surface."}]},"related_words":{"derivatives":["artesian","aquifer","groundwater","hydrogeology"],"phrasal_verbs":[]},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"N/A","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"The term 'subartesian' is a technical term used in the field of hydrogeology.

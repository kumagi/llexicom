It combines 'reason' with a modified form of 'reassured' to indicate a state of lacking reassurance despite logical explanations or attempts to provide comfort. Due to its rarity and somewhat contrived nature, it is best used in formal or technical contexts where a precise and nuanced description of a lack of reassurance is required.

It refers to the transplantation of tissue or an organ between two genetically identical individuals, such as identical twins. The key characteristic of an isograft is the minimal risk of immune rejection due to the genetic similarity between the donor and recipient. This term is most likely encountered in scientific literature, medical textbooks, or discussions among healthcare professionals.

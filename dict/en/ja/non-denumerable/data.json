A non-denumerable set is an infinite set that cannot be put into such a correspondence. This implies that the non-denumerable set is 'larger' than the set of natural numbers.

It describes infinite sets that are 'too large' to be counted in the same way we count regular numbers. Think of it like this: you can list all the whole numbers (1, 2, 3...), but you can't list all the real numbers (numbers with decimal points) because there are infinitely more of them between any two whole numbers. So, the set of real numbers is non-denumerable. It's a concept used to compare the 'size' of different infinite sets."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The power set of the natural numbers is non-denumerable.","translation":"自然数の冪集合は非可算である。","type":"general","meaning_category":"mathematics"},{"sentence":"Georg Cantor proved that the set of real numbers is non-denumerable using a diagonalization argument.","translation":"ゲオルク・カントールは、対角線論法を用いて実数の集合が非可算であることを証明した。","type":"historical","meaning_category":"mathematics"}]}

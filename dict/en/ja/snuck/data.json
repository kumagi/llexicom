While 'sneaked' is the traditionally correct form, 'snuck' emerged in American English in the late 19th century and has become increasingly common, though it's still sometimes considered informal. The verb 'sneak' itself comes from Middle English 'sneken,' possibly related to Old English 'snican' (to creep).","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/snʌk/","syllables":"snuck"},"inflection":{"verb_forms":{"present_simple":["sneak","sneaks"],"past_simple":"snuck / sneaked","past_participle":"snuck / sneaked","present_participle":"sneaking"}},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Snuck' and 'sneaked' are both acceptable past tense and past participle forms of 'sneak.'

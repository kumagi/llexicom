It can refer to physical environments (like terrain) or abstract spaces (like networks or graphs). In robotics, it's crucial for designing robots that can move effectively through different terrains. In graph theory, it relates to the connectivity of a graph.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The traversability was good, so we traversed the mountain easily.","correct":"✓ The traversability was good, so we were able to traverse the mountain easily.","note":"'Traversability' is a noun, referring to the quality of being traversable.

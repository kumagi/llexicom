It is a maximal filter, meaning that it is not properly contained in any other filter on the same set. Ultrafilters have important applications in various areas of mathematics, including the construction of ultraproducts and the study of compactness.","priority":"☆☆☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[],"priority":"☆☆☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["ultrafiltration"],"phrasal_verbs":[]},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"N/A","frequency_google_ngram":"Extremely low frequency.","priority":"☆☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C2","text":"The term \"ultrafilter\" is a highly specialized mathematical concept used primarily in advanced set theory, topology, and model theory.

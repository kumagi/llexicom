It describes a situation where a process or sequence does not approach a specific value or solution. For example, if you're trying to solve an equation using a computer program, and the program keeps running without getting closer to an answer, that's non-convergence. It's the opposite of \"convergence,\" where the process gets closer and closer to a solution.

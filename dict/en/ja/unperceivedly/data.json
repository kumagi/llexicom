It's not a common word in everyday conversation, so it's more likely to appear in written texts or formal speech. If you want to use a simpler word with a similar meaning, you could use \"unnoticeably\" or \"imperceptibly.\" Remember that adverbs modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs, so \"unperceivedly\" describes how an action is performed. For example, \"The cat slipped unperceivedly into the room\" means that the cat entered the room without anyone noticing."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The effects of the policy change spread unperceivedly throughout the organization.","translation":"政策変更の影響は、組織全体に気づかれずに広がった。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"気づかれずに"},{"sentence":"The seasons change unperceivedly, until one day we realize summer is over.","translation":"季節は気づかれずに移り変わり、ある日、夏が終わったことに気づく。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"知られずに"},{"sentence":"The water level rose unperceivedly during the night.","translation":"夜の間に水位は気づかれずに上昇した。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"感知されずに"}]}

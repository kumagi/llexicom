Because the isotope is radioactive, its presence can be easily detected, even in small quantities. Radiotracers are used in a variety of fields, including medicine, environmental science, and industry. In medicine, they are used for diagnostic imaging and to study metabolic processes. In environmental science, they are used to track pollutants and study hydrological cycles. In industry, they are used to monitor processes and detect leaks.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The radiotracer was injected to the patient for treatment.","correct":"✓ The radiotracer was injected into the patient for diagnosis.","note":"Radiotracers are primarily used for diagnosis, not treatment.

It refers to a radioactive substance that is used to track the movement or distribution of another substance. Understanding this term requires knowledge of basic scientific concepts like isotopes and radioactivity. It is typically encountered in specialized contexts such as medical imaging, environmental studies, or industrial monitoring. The word is formed by combining 'radio-' (referring to radioactivity) and 'tracer' (referring to the act of tracking)."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The **radiotracer** allowed doctors to visualize the blood flow in the patient's heart.","translation":"放射性トレーサーにより、医師は患者の心臓の血流を可視化することができました。","type":"general","meaning_category":"medical imaging"},{"sentence":"Scientists used a **radiotracer** to track the movement of groundwater.","translation":"科学者は放射性トレーサーを使用して地下水の動きを追跡しました。","type":"general","meaning_category":"environmental science"},{"sentence":"The **radiotracer** helped identify a leak in the underground pipeline.","translation":"放射性トレーサーは、地下パイプラインの漏れを特定するのに役立ちました。","type":"general","meaning_category":"industrial application"}]}

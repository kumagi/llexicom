It is often used to describe spaces or materials that absorb sound rather than reflect it, leading to a 'dead' acoustic environment. It can also describe a voice or musical instrument that lacks richness and carrying power due to poor resonance.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The speaker was irresonant with the audience.","correct":"✓ The speaker was not resonant with the audience.","note":"'Irresonant' describes a lack of physical resonance, not a lack of connection or agreement.

It's crucial to understand that homotaxia does not necessarily imply that the rock layers were formed at the same time.

It describes the condition where rock layers in different locations show similar sequences or arrangements, but it's important to note that this similarity doesn't automatically mean these layers formed at the same time. The term is used to avoid the assumption of synchronous formation based solely on the similarity of rock sequences.

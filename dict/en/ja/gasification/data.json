This gas can then be used for various purposes, such as generating electricity, producing chemicals, or creating transportation fuels. Unlike combustion, gasification occurs with a controlled amount of oxygen, which prevents complete oxidation to carbon dioxide.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The gasification is when a solid turns into liquid.","correct":"✓ Gasification is when a solid turns into gas.","note":"Gasification is the process of turning a solid or liquid into a gas, not a liquid."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["gasify (verb: ガス化する)","gasifier (noun: ガス化装置)"],"phrasal_verbs":[],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C1","frequency_google_ngram":"Relatively low frequency, technical term.","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Gasification' is a technical term referring to the process of converting solid or liquid materials into gas.

It describes someone who is not inclined to ask questions or make requests, often because they are content or unassuming. It is not commonly used in modern English, and more common alternatives like \"undemanding\" or \"unquestioning\" are often preferred. The verb form is even less common and typically avoided. Understanding the prefix \"un-\" and the base word \"asking\" is helpful in deciphering its meaning.

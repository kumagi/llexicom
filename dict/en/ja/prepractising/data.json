It describes the act of practicing something in advance of a performance or event. While the meaning is straightforward, it's not a widely used term, and more common alternatives like \"rehearsing\" or \"practicing beforehand\" are often preferred. The word is generally understood, but its rarity makes it more suitable for advanced English speakers or specific contexts where the nuance of pre-emptive practice is desired."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The actors were prepractising their lines backstage.","translation":"俳優たちは舞台裏で台詞の予行練習をしていた。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"予行練習"},{"sentence":"Before the big game, the team spent hours prepractising their plays.","translation":"大試合の前に、チームは何時間もプレイの予習をした。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"事前練習"}]}

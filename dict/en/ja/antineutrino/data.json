It's a fundamental particle, meaning it's not made up of smaller parts. Antineutrinos don't have an electric charge and barely interact with other matter, making them very hard to detect. They're created in certain types of nuclear reactions, like those in nuclear reactors or during the explosion of a star (supernova). Scientists study antineutrinos to learn more about the basic building blocks of the universe and the forces that govern them."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The experiment aims to detect antineutrinos from distant supernovae.","translation":"その実験は、遠くの超新星からの反ニュートリノを検出することを目的としています。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"反粒子"},{"sentence":"Nuclear reactors are a significant source of antineutrinos.","translation":"原子炉は反ニュートリノの重要な発生源です。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"反粒子"}]}

It often relates to systems, plans, or procedures. It emphasizes the practical aspects of whether something can be successfully implemented and maintained in a real-world setting.

It's not a common word in everyday conversation, but it's important in technical and business contexts when discussing the practicality and effectiveness of something.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The company focused on improving the operationality of its logistics network.","translation":"その会社は物流ネットワークの運用性の向上に注力した。","type":"general","meaning_category":"運用性"},{"sentence":"The study assessed the operationality of the proposed emergency response plan.","translation":"その研究は提案された緊急時対応計画の実用性を評価した。","type":"technical","meaning_category":"実用性"},{"sentence":"The military tested the operationality of the new drone in various weather conditions.","translation":"軍は様々な気象条件下で新型ドローンの運用性をテストした。","type":"military","meaning_category":"運用性"},{"sentence":"The project aims to enhance the operationality and efficiency of the manufacturing process.","translation":"そのプロジェクトは製造プロセスの運用性と効率の向上を目指している。","type":"business","meaning_category":"運用性"}]}

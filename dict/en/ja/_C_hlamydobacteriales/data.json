The classification of organisms within this group has been subject to change with advances in molecular phylogenetics."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The order Chlamydobacteriales includes bacteria that form filamentous sheaths.","translation":"クラミドバクテリア目は、糸状の鞘を形成する細菌を含む。","type":"definition","meaning_category":"General"},{"sentence":"Historically, Sphaerotilus natans was classified within the Chlamydobacteriales.","translation":"歴史的に、フサオ菌（Sphaerotilus natans）はクラミドバクテリア目に分類されていた。","type":"example","meaning_category":"Classification"}]}

It is the opposite of \"ostensive,\" which means pointing something out directly. Therefore, \"nonostensive\" means *not* pointing something out directly, but instead relying on context, implication, or other indirect means of communication. It's most often used to describe definitions or teaching methods that don't use direct examples. This word is most likely to be encountered in academic or philosophical writing.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The therapist used a nonostensive approach to help the patient explore their feelings.","translation":"セラピストは、患者が自分の感情を探求するのを助けるために、非指示的なアプローチを用いた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"間接的なアプローチ"},{"sentence":"A nonostensive definition of 'justice' might involve discussing its various aspects without giving a concrete example.","translation":"「正義」の非指示的な定義は、具体的な例を挙げずにそのさまざまな側面について議論することを含むかもしれない。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"間接的な定義"},{"sentence":"Nonostensive learning encourages students to construct their own understanding through exploration and discovery.","translation":"非指示的な学習は、生徒が探求と発見を通して自分自身の理解を構築することを奨励する。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"間接的な学習"}]}

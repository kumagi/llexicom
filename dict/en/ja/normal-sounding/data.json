It's used when you want to emphasize that a sound is not strange or unusual. For example, if a machine was making a weird noise and then stopped, you might say it's 'normal-sounding' again to indicate that the problem seems to be resolved. It's a fairly straightforward term, but it's not as common as simpler alternatives like 'sounds normal.'"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"After the repair, the engine was finally normal-sounding again.","translation":"修理後、エンジンはついにまた普通に聞こえるようになった。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"ordinary sound"},{"sentence":"The doctor listened to my lungs and said they were normal-sounding.","translation":"医者は私の肺の音を聞いて、普通に聞こえると言った。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"typical sound"},{"sentence":"The recording engineer adjusted the levels until the vocals were normal-sounding.","translation":"録音技師はボーカルが普通に聞こえるまでレベルを調整した。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"expected sound"}]}

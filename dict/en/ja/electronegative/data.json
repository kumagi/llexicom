If an atom is 'electronegative', it means it pulls electrons towards itself more strongly than other atoms in the bond. This concept is important for understanding how different elements combine to form molecules and compounds. It's typically discussed in advanced chemistry courses.","priority":"★★★"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"Chlorine is more electronegative than hydrogen.","translation":"塩素は水素よりも電気陰性度が高いです。","type":"example","meaning_category":"General"},{"sentence":"The electronegative nature of oxygen allows it to form strong bonds with other elements.","translation":"酸素の電気陰性的な性質により、他の元素と強い結合を形成することができます。","type":"example","meaning_category":"Chemical bonding"},{"sentence":"The difference in electronegativity between two atoms determines the type of chemical bond formed.","translation":"2つの原子間の電気陰性度の差によって、形成される化学結合の種類が決まります。","type":"example","meaning_category":"Chemical bonding"}]}

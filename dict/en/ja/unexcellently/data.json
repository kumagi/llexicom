It is formed by adding the prefix 'un-' to the adverb 'excellently'. Due to its rarity and formality, it is not commonly used in everyday conversation or writing. More common synonyms such as 'poorly' or 'badly' are generally preferred. Its use is typically limited to formal or technical contexts where a precise and nuanced description of the quality of performance is required."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The project was managed unexcellently, leading to significant delays and cost overruns.","translation":"プロジェクトは拙劣に管理され、大幅な遅延とコスト超過につながった。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"下手に"},{"sentence":"Although he tried his best, he played the violin unexcellently.","translation":"彼は最善を尽くしたが、バイオリンを下手くそに演奏した。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"拙劣に"}]}

'Memory' refers to the computer's RAM. 'Degrading' means causing a decline in quality or effectiveness. Thus, 'memory-degrading' describes something that causes a decline in the availability or performance of memory.","priority":"N/A"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/ˈmɛməri dɪˈɡreɪdɪŋ/","syllables":"mem-o-ry-de-grad-ing"},"inflection":{"notes":"This is an adjective, so it doesn't inflect in the typical verb or noun sense. It can be used in comparative and superlative forms (more memory-degrading, most memory-degrading), but that is less common."},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Memory-degrading' is a technical term primarily used in the context of computer science and software engineering. It describes a situation where a program or process gradually consumes more and more memory over time without releasing it properly. This can lead to performance issues, system crashes, or other problems. It is often associated with memory leaks, where memory is allocated but not deallocated when it is no longer needed.","priority":"N/A"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The video game is degrading my memory.","correct":"✓ The video game is memory-degrading, or The video game is affecting my memory.","note":"'Memory-degrading' refers to the computer's memory (RAM), not human memory.

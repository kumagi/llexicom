If the moving circle rolls around the *inside* of the fixed circle, the curve is called a hypotrochoid. A Spirograph is a toy that can draw epitrochoid and hypotrochoid curves.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[],"priority":"☆☆☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["epitrochoidal (adjective)"],"phrasal_verbs":[],"priority":"☆☆☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low","priority":"☆☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C2","text":"This term is highly technical and specific to mathematics, particularly geometry.

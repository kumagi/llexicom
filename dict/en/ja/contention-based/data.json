This is common in computer networks, especially Ethernet and Wi-Fi. The main idea is that devices try to access the network whenever they need to, and if two devices try to access it at the same time, there's a collision. The system then has a mechanism to detect and resolve these collisions. It's a simple and scalable approach, but it can have performance issues when many devices are trying to access the network at the same time."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The wireless network uses a contention-based protocol to manage access to the shared bandwidth.","translation":"その無線ネットワークは、共有帯域幅へのアクセスを管理するために、コンテンションベースのプロトコルを使用しています。","type":"general","meaning_category":"Network Access"},{"sentence":"In a contention-based system, collisions are inevitable, requiring robust collision detection mechanisms.","translation":"コンテンションベースのシステムでは、衝突は避けられず、堅牢な衝突検出メカニズムが必要です。","type":"technical","meaning_category":"Collision Management"},{"sentence":"Compared to token-based systems, contention-based networks are generally easier to deploy and manage.","translation":"トークンベースのシステムと比較して、コンテンションベースのネットワークは一般的に展開と管理が容易です。","type":"comparison","meaning_category":"Network Comparison"}]}

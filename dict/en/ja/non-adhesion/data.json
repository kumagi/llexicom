It's used in various fields, such as materials science (when a coating doesn't stick to a surface) and medicine (when tissues don't abnormally connect after surgery). It's essentially the opposite of 'adhesion'. Because it's a more specialized term, it's not as commonly encountered as more basic vocabulary.

More commonly, one would use 'more semiporous' and 'most semiporous'."},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Semiporous' describes materials that are neither fully porous nor completely impermeable. They allow some substances to pass through their structure due to the presence of pores or voids, but they restrict or prevent the passage of other substances. This property makes semiporous materials useful in various applications, such as filtration, separation, and controlled release.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The material is semi-porous, so it's completely waterproof.","correct":"✓ The material is semiporous, so it's partially waterproof.","note":"Semiporous materials are not completely waterproof, as they allow some substances to pass through. The correct term would be 'partially waterproof' or 'water-resistant'."},{"incorrect":"✗ Semiporous means the same as nonporous.","correct":"✓ Semiporous means partially porous, while nonporous means not porous at all.","note":"Semiporous and nonporous are opposite concepts.

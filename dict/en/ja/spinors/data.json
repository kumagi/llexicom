They are essential for describing particles with half-integer spin, such as electrons, in relativistic quantum mechanics. Unlike vectors, spinors change sign under a 360-degree rotation, requiring a 720-degree rotation to return to their original state.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Spinors are same as vectors.","correct":"✓ Spinors are different from vectors.","note":"Spinors transform differently than vectors under rotations.

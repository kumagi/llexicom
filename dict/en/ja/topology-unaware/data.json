It describes systems or algorithms that make decisions or operate without considering the underlying network's structure (topology). This can lead to inefficiencies, suboptimal performance, or increased resource consumption. The opposite of \"topology-unaware\" is \"topology-aware,\" which describes systems that actively use topology information to optimize their behavior.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The system is topology unaware.","correct":"✓ The system is topology-unaware.","note":"The hyphen is important to clearly indicate that \"topology-unaware\" is a single compound adjective.

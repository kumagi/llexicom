Keratinization is the process by which cells in the epidermis (the outer layer of skin) mature and become filled with keratin, a tough, protective protein. When this process is impaired, it can lead to a variety of skin disorders, characterized by thin, fragile, or easily damaged skin. It is the opposite of hyperkeratosis, which involves excessive thickening of the stratum corneum (the outermost layer of the epidermis).","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The doctor prescribed a medication for hyperkeratosis when the patient had aceratosis.","correct":"✓ The doctor prescribed a medication for aceratosis.","note":"Ensure the diagnosis is correct before prescribing medication, as treatments for hyperkeratosis and aceratosis are different."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["akeratosis","hypokeratosis","keratosis","hyperkeratosis"],"phrasal_verbs":[],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"N/A","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency","priority":"☆☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C2","text":"Aceratosis is a technical term used in dermatology to describe a condition characterized by a deficiency in the normal keratinization process of the skin.

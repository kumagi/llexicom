It describes a specific type of map projection where each meridian is projected onto a cone tangent to the globe at that meridian. This results in a map where all parallels are circular arcs, but only the central meridian is a straight line. Because it's a specialized term, it's not commonly encountered outside of fields like geography, surveying, or GIS (Geographic Information Systems)."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The surveyor used a polyconic projection to create an accurate map of the region.","translation":"測量技師は、その地域の正確な地図を作成するために多円錐図法を使用した。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"多円錐図法の"}]}

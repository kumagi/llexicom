It's used in religious contexts, specifically within Christian denominations that have pastors. The word combines \"pastor,\" which means a religious leader or shepherd of a congregation, and \"elect,\" which means chosen or selected. The term is used to describe the person's status during the transition period before they are formally installed or ordained into the position. Understanding this term requires familiarity with religious terminology and church governance.

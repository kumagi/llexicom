It means to drag or force someone to go somewhere, often against their will, particularly to appear before a court or authority. Due to its specific and somewhat archaic usage, it is more likely to be encountered in advanced reading materials or formal writing. It's important to distinguish it from the more common verb 'hail,' which has different meanings (e.g., to greet or praise)."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The protesters were **haled** away by the police.","translation":"抗議者たちは警察によって引きずり去られた。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"無理やり引っ張る"},{"sentence":"The witness was **haled** before the grand jury to testify.","translation":"証人は証言のために大陪審に召喚された。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"召喚する"}]}

It is often used in the context of family relationships, traditions, values, and memories. The word is not as commonly used as 'love' or 'affection,' but it conveys a specific sense of deep and tender care.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ He showed his cherishment by ignoring her.","correct":"✓ He showed his cherishment by being attentive to her needs.","note":"Cherishment implies care and attention, not neglect.

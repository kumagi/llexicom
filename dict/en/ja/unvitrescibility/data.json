It describes the property of a material that resists being transformed into a glassy or vitreous state when subjected to heat and subsequent cooling. Understanding this term requires familiarity with the processes involved in vitrification and the characteristics of glassy materials. Its use is confined to specialized scientific and engineering discussions.

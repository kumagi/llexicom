You'll mostly see it in forums, comments, and messages online. Sometimes, people use it sarcastically to mean 'in my hardly opinion,' implying that their opinion is very important. It's good to know what it means if you spend time online, but it's not something you'd use in formal writing."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"IMHO, the new design is a step backward.","translation":"IMHO、新しいデザインは後退していると思います。","type":"example","meaning_category":"opinion"},{"sentence":"IMHO, the book was better than the movie.","translation":"IMHO、本は映画よりも良かった。","type":"example","meaning_category":"opinion"},{"sentence":"IMHO, pineapple does not belong on pizza.","translation":"IMHO、パイナップルはピザに合わない。","type":"example","meaning_category":"opinion"}]}

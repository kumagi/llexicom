This means it lacks the ordered crystalline structure found in typical solids. It's commonly used in cryobiology to preserve biological samples and in nuclear waste management for long-term storage. In soil science, it refers to the transformation of soil into a glass-like material, often due to extreme heat. The key aspect is the formation of a non-crystalline, glassy state.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The vitrification was crystal clear.","correct":"✓ The vitrified material was crystal clear.","note":"Vitrification is the *process*, not the resulting material.

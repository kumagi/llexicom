It describes a life cycle where sexual reproduction alternates with parthenogenetic (asexual) reproduction. This strategy allows for rapid population growth when conditions are favorable (parthenogenesis) and genetic diversity when conditions are less predictable (sexual reproduction).","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The heterogonic structure of the building was interesting.","correct":"✓ The heterogeneous structure of the building was interesting.","note":"'Heterogonic' refers to a specific type of reproductive cycle.

It works by storing the repeated value and the number of times it occurs, rather than storing each instance of the value. This method is effective when data has long sequences of identical values, such as in simple images or text files with repeating characters. RLE is a lossless compression method, meaning that the original data can be perfectly reconstructed from the compressed data."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The image was compressed using RLE to reduce its file size.","translation":"画像はファイルサイズを小さくするためにRLEを使用して圧縮されました。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"ランレングス符号化"},{"sentence":"RLE is a simple but effective compression algorithm.","translation":"RLEは単純ですが効果的な圧縮アルゴリズムです。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"ランレングス符号化"}]}

It refers to a metrical structure containing or consisting of two spondaic feet (spondees). A spondee itself is a metrical foot made up of two stressed syllables. Therefore, 'dispondaic' is used to describe a particularly heavy or emphatic rhythmic pattern in verse, often found in classical Greek and Latin poetry. Due to its technical nature, it is unlikely to be encountered outside academic or specialized contexts."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The poet employed a dispondaic meter to convey a sense of solemnity and weight.","translation":"詩人は、厳粛さと重々しさを伝えるために、ジスポンダイックの韻律を用いた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"韻律"}]}

It's often used in formal discussions about law, policy, and ethics. Because it's a more specialized word, it's less common in everyday conversation and more often found in written or academic contexts. Understanding this word requires a grasp of legal and political concepts. It's important to note that 'illegalizing' refers to the *process* of making something illegal, not the state of being illegal itself."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The government is considering illegalizing the sale of e-cigarettes to minors.","translation":"政府は未成年者への電子タバコの販売を違法化することを検討している。","type":"gerund","meaning_category":"違法化すること"},{"sentence":"Illegalizing certain types of weapons is a controversial issue.","translation":"特定の種類の武器を違法化することは、物議を醸す問題である。","type":"gerund","meaning_category":"違法化すること"},{"sentence":"The debate over illegalizing hate speech continues.","translation":"ヘイトスピーチの違法化に関する議論は続いている。","type":"gerund","meaning_category":"違法化すること"}]}

It's like a digital notepad that remembers what you wrote even after you unplug it. What makes EEPROM special is that you can erase and rewrite the data stored on it using electrical signals. This is different from older types of memory like EPROM, which needed ultraviolet light to erase data. EEPROMs are often used in devices like computers, smartphones, and other electronics to store settings, firmware, and other important information that needs to be saved even when the device is turned off. Because they can be rewritten, they're useful for storing information that might need to be updated or changed later on.","priority":"★★★"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The device stores its configuration settings in **EEPROM**.","translation":"そのデバイスは構成設定をEEPROMに保存します。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"memory"},{"sentence":"We can update the firmware by reprogramming the **EEPROM**.","translation":"EEPROMを再プログラムすることで、ファームウェアを更新できます。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"memory"}]}

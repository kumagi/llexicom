These different arrangements are also known as conformers or rotamers. Conformators are not isomers in the traditional sense because they can interconvert without breaking chemical bonds. The study of conformators is important in understanding the properties and reactivity of molecules.","priority":"☆☆☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[],"priority":"☆☆☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["conformation (配座)","conformational (配座の)"],"priority":"☆☆☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"N/A","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency","priority":"☆☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C2","text":"'Conformator' is a technical term used in chemistry, specifically in the field of stereochemistry.

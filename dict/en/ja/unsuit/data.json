It means to make someone or something inappropriate or unfit for a particular purpose. It's less frequently used than its adjective form, 'unsuitable'. Understanding the difference between the verb 'unsuit' and the adjective 'unsuitable' is key. The verb describes the action of making something unfit, while the adjective describes the state of being unfit. Because it is rare, it's more important to recognize it than to actively use it. You're more likely to encounter 'unsuitable' in everyday language."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The scandal unsuited him to be a leader.","translation":"そのスキャンダルが、彼をリーダーとして不適格にした。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"不適当にする"},{"sentence":"The renovations unwittingly unsuited the house for elderly residents.","translation":"改修工事は、意図せずその家を高齢者居住者にとって不向きにした。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"不適当にする"}]}

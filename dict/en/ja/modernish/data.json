It's like saying something is 'kind of' modern. You might use it when something has some modern features but also has elements of other styles, or when it's trying to be modern but doesn't quite achieve it fully. It's a relatively uncommon word, so it's more likely to be encountered in writing or conversation among people with a good vocabulary. It's more nuanced than just saying \"modern.\""},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The hotel had a modernish lobby, with sleek furniture and abstract art.","translation":"そのホテルのロビーは、洗練された家具と抽象芸術があり、やや現代的な雰囲気だった。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"somewhat modern"},{"sentence":"Her clothing style could be described as modernish, with a hint of vintage flair.","translation":"彼女の服装のスタイルは、やや現代的で、ヴィンテージの雰囲気が少しあると言えるだろう。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"resembling modern styles"},{"sentence":"The restaurant's decor was modernish, but the menu featured traditional dishes.","translation":"そのレストランの内装はモダン風だったが、メニューは伝統的な料理が中心だった。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"somewhat modern"}]}

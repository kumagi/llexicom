The first, and more historically significant, refers to individuals who are systematically erased from official records and public memory, typically by totalitarian regimes. This involves removing their names from documents, photographs, and historical accounts, effectively denying their existence. The second, more general meaning, describes someone who is treated as insignificant or ignored, even if their existence is not officially denied. The first meaning carries a stronger connotation of political repression and historical revisionism.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ He was a nonperson because he didn't have any friends.","correct":"✓ He was a non-person because he was ostracized by the group.","note":"The term 'non-person' implies a deliberate act of exclusion or erasure, not simply a lack of social connections."},{"incorrect":"✗ The company made him a nonperson after he retired.","correct":"✓ The company made him feel like a non-person after he retired.","note":"Retirement doesn't automatically make someone a 'non-person' in the Orwellian sense.

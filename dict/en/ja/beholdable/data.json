The verb \"behold\" comes from Middle English \"biholden,\" which is composed of \"bi-\" (by, near) and \"holden\" (to hold, to keep).

It emphasizes the visual impact and worthiness of something to be seen and admired. It suggests that the object or scene is not just visible, but also impressive or remarkable in some way.

It's not a word you'll hear every day; it's more likely to appear in writing, especially when describing something beautiful, impressive, or awe-inspiring. Think of it as more than just 'visible' – it suggests something special that deserves attention. Because it's not a common word, using simpler alternatives like 'remarkable' or 'spectacular' might be more appropriate in everyday conversation."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The aurora borealis was a truly **beholdable** phenomenon, painting the night sky with vibrant colors.","translation":"オーロラはまさに注目に値する現象であり、鮮やかな色彩で夜空を彩っていた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"remarkable sight"},{"sentence":"The artist created a **beholdable** sculpture that captivated all who saw it.","translation":"そのアーティストは、見る人すべてを魅了する、注目に値する彫刻を制作した。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"worthy of admiration"},{"sentence":"From the mountain peak, the valley below was a **beholdable** panorama of natural beauty.","translation":"山の頂上からは、眼下の谷は自然の美しさが見事に広がる、注目に値するパノラマだった。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"impressive view"}]}

It is a rare metal found naturally on Earth almost exclusively combined with other elements. It was identified as a new element in 1781 and first isolated as a metal in 1783. Its most well-known use is in the filaments of incandescent light bulbs due to its extremely high melting point.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Tungsten is a very reactive metal.","correct":"✓ Tungsten is a relatively unreactive metal.","note":"Tungsten is known for its inertness and resistance to corrosion, not its reactivity."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["tungstic","wolframite"],"phrasal_verbs":[]},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"B2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Tungsten' is a technical term primarily encountered in scientific or engineering contexts.

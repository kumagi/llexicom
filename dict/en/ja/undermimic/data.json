It combines 'under-' (meaning 'not enough' or 'insufficiently') with 'mimic' (meaning 'to imitate'). The word can be used as a verb to describe the action of poorly imitating something, or as a noun to describe the result of that poor imitation. Because it is not a common word, it is more likely to be encountered in advanced texts or specialized discussions about performance or art."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The student's undermimic of the teacher's accent was more confusing than funny.","translation":"生徒の先生のアクセントの下手な模倣は、面白さよりも混乱を招いた。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"模倣が下手である"},{"sentence":"The play was criticized for being an undermimic of a more successful production.","translation":"その劇は、より成功した作品の不十分な模倣であると批判された。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"不十分な模倣"}]}

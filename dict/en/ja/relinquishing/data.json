It suggests a deliberate and often reluctant act of letting go. It's not a word you'd use in everyday conversation, but it's common in legal, business, and political contexts. For example, 'He is relinquishing his position as CEO' means he is giving up his role as the chief executive officer. It's a more sophisticated way of saying 'giving up'.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"She was reluctantly **relinquishing** her dreams of becoming a dancer.","translation":"彼女はダンサーになるという夢を不承不承ながら諦めようとしていた。","type":"verb (present participle)","meaning_category":"放棄すること"},{"sentence":"The company is **relinquishing** its control over the subsidiary.","translation":"その会社は子会社に対する支配権を放棄しようとしている。","type":"verb (present participle)","meaning_category":"手放すこと"},{"sentence":"**Relinquishing** the throne was a difficult decision for the king.","translation":"王位を放棄することは、王にとって難しい決断だった。","type":"verb (gerund)","meaning_category":"譲ること"}]}

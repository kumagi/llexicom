It describes algorithms, models, or functions that do not consider the 'weight' or importance assigned to different inputs or parameters. This can be a desirable property in some cases, where all inputs should be treated equally, or a limitation in others, where some inputs are more important than others.","priority":"N/A"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[],"priority":"N/A"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["weight-sensitivity","weight-aware"],"related_terms":["feature importance","parameter tuning","machine learning","algorithm design"]},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"N/A","frequency_google_ngram":"Low","priority":"N/A"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Weight-insensitive' is a technical term used in computer science and machine learning to describe something that doesn't consider the importance (weight) of different parts. Imagine a voting system where every vote counts the same, no matter who casts it. That's weight-insensitive. It's the opposite of something that gives more importance to certain things based on their weight or value."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"A weight-insensitive scoring system treats all data points equally.","translation":"重み非依存のスコアリングシステムは、すべてのデータポイントを平等に扱います。","type":"general","meaning_category":"General"},{"sentence":"The weight-insensitive approach simplifies the model but may reduce accuracy.","translation":"重み非依存のアプローチはモデルを単純化しますが、精度が低下する可能性があります。","type":"technical","meaning_category":"Technical"}]}

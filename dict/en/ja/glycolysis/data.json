It occurs in the cytoplasm of cells and does not require oxygen (anaerobic). The process involves a series of enzymatic reactions that break down glucose, a six-carbon sugar, into two molecules of pyruvate, a three-carbon molecule. This breakdown releases a small amount of energy in the form of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) and NADH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide). The pyruvate produced can then be further processed in other metabolic pathways, such as the citric acid cycle (Krebs cycle) under aerobic conditions, or fermentation under anaerobic conditions.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Glycolysis is the same as gluconeogenesis.","correct":"✓ Glycolysis is the breakdown of glucose, while gluconeogenesis is the synthesis of glucose.","note":"Glycolysis and gluconeogenesis are opposing pathways.

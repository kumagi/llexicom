Hydroforming is a manufacturing technique that uses a pressurized fluid (typically water or oil) to shape ductile metals like aluminum, stainless steel, or brass into complex shapes. This process is often used to create structural components in the automotive, aerospace, and other industries where strength and weight are critical factors.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The hydroformer is using to cut metal.","correct":"✓ The hydroformer is used to form metal.","note":"Hydroformers are used for shaping or forming metal, not cutting it.

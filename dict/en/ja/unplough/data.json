It is formed by adding the prefix \"un-\" to the verb \"plough,\" which means to turn over and break up soil with a plough. Therefore, \"unplough\" means to not plough, or to leave land unploughed. Due to its specific and somewhat technical nature related to agriculture, this word is more likely to be encountered in specialized contexts or literature dealing with farming, conservation, or land management. Its usage is infrequent in general conversation or writing."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The decision to unplough the meadow was driven by ecological concerns.","translation":"その牧草地を耕さないという決定は、生態学的な懸念からなされた。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"not plough"},{"sentence":"They unploughed the area to allow native plants to regenerate.","translation":"彼らは在来植物が再生するようにその地域を耕作しなかった。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"not plough"}]}

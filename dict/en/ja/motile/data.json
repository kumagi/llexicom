It distinguishes these from 'sessile' or 'immotile' entities that are fixed in place or lack the ability to move independently.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The plant is motile.","correct":"✓ The plant is not motile. / ✓ The plant is sessile.","note":"Most plants are sessile, meaning they are fixed in one place.

Using 'motile' for a typical plant would be incorrect."},{"incorrect":"✗ The car is motile.","correct":"✓ The car is mobile.","note":"While a car can move, 'motile' is generally reserved for living organisms that move spontaneously.

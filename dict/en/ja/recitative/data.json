It refers to a style of singing that is more like speech than a typical song. The purpose of recitative is to move the story forward by delivering dialogue and narration in a way that is expressive but not as melodically complex as an aria. Understanding recitative is important for appreciating the structure and dramatic flow of these musical forms. It is a specialized term, so it is not commonly used outside of discussions about classical music."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The tenor delivered the recitative with great emotion.","translation":"そのテノール歌手は、非常に感情を込めて叙唱を歌い上げた。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"音楽"},{"sentence":"The composer used recitative to bridge the gap between the spoken dialogue and the arias.","translation":"作曲家は、叙唱を用いて、話し言葉の対話とアリアの間のギャップを埋めた。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"音楽"},{"sentence":"The audience appreciated the clarity of the recitative, which helped them follow the story.","translation":"観客は叙唱の明瞭さを評価し、それによって物語を理解することができた。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"音楽"}]}

It's not a very common word, so it's more likely to appear in formal writing or speech. You can understand it by breaking it down: \"un-\" means \"not,\" \"govern\" means \"to control,\" \"-able\" means \"capable of being,\" and \"-ly\" turns it into an adverb. So, \"ungovernably\" means \"not capable of being controlled, in a certain manner.\""},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The mob surged ungovernably through the streets.","translation":"暴徒は手に負えないほど街路を押し寄せた。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"uncontrollably"},{"sentence":"The weeds grew ungovernably in the neglected garden.","translation":"手入れの行き届かない庭では、雑草が制御不能に生い茂った。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"unmanageably"},{"sentence":"The discussion spiraled ungovernably into a heated argument.","translation":"議論は手に負えないほど激しい口論へと発展した。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"chaotically"}]}

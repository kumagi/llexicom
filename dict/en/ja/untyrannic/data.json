To understand it, one must first understand 'tyrannical,' which means characteristic of a tyrant – a cruel and oppressive ruler. Therefore, 'untyrannic' means not cruel, not oppressive, and not exhibiting the characteristics of a tyrant. It is often used in political or philosophical contexts to describe a just and fair form of governance or leadership. Because of its rarity and the complexity of the concepts it describes, it is more likely to be encountered in advanced texts.","note":"This word is uncommon and may not be recognized by all native English speakers."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The citizens appreciated the governor's untyrannic approach to governing.","translation":"市民は知事の圧政的でない統治手法を評価した。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"Not tyrannical"},{"sentence":"The organization strived to create an untyrannic environment where all members felt valued and respected.","translation":"その組織は、すべてのメンバーが尊重され、大切にされていると感じる、圧政的でない環境を作り出すよう努めた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"Not oppressive"},{"sentence":"The new constitution aimed to establish an untyrannic system of government, ensuring checks and balances on power.","translation":"新しい憲法は、権力に対する抑制と均衡を確保し、圧政的でない政府システムを確立することを目指した。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"Not despotic"}]}

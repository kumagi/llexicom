The solder coating improves the wetting of the wire with solder during the actual soldering process, resulting in a stronger and more reliable connection. It also protects the wire from corrosion, which can degrade the connection over time.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ I wired-tin the cable.","correct":"✓ I tinned the cable. / ✓ I performed wire-tinning on the cable.","note":"'Wire-tinning' is a noun referring to the process.

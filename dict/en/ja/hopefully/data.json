The first, and more traditional, is to describe the manner in which someone does something, i.e., with hope. The second, and more controversial, usage is as a sentence adverb, expressing the speaker's hope that something will happen. While this usage is very common, some consider it grammatically incorrect, arguing that an adverb should modify a verb, adjective, or another adverb, not an entire sentence. Despite the criticism, the sentence adverb usage is widely accepted and understood.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Hopefully, I will to pass the exam.","correct":"✓ Hopefully, I will pass the exam.","note":"When used as a sentence adverb, \"hopefully\" does not require an additional preposition like \"to\" before the verb."},{"incorrect":"✗ She waited hopefully the news.","correct":"✓ She waited hopefully for the news.","note":"When describing someone waiting with hope, the correct preposition is \"for.\""}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["hope (noun, verb)","hopeful (adjective)","hopeless (adjective)","hopelessly (adverb)"],"idioms_phrases":["None commonly used with 'hopefully'."],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"B2","frequency_google_ngram":"Moderately frequent.","priority":"★★☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"B2","text":"'Hopefully' is an adverb that means 'in a hopeful way' or 'it is hoped that'. It's often used at the beginning of a sentence to express a wish or expectation about something. For example, 'Hopefully, it won't rain tomorrow' means 'I hope it won't rain tomorrow'. Some people think this usage is incorrect and prefer to say 'I hope that...' instead. However, using 'hopefully' in this way is very common and widely understood. It can also describe the way someone does something, like 'She looked at him hopefully', meaning she looked at him with hope."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"Hopefully, the meeting will be productive.","translation":"うまくいけば、会議は有益なものになるだろう。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"願わくば、うまくいけば"},{"sentence":"She smiled hopefully at the interviewer.","translation":"彼女は面接官に期待を込めて微笑んだ。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"希望に満ちて"}]}

It is formed by adding the prefix \"un-\" (meaning \"not\") to the more common word \"gaping.\" Therefore, \"ungaping\" means \"not gaping.\" It is typically used in descriptive writing to indicate the absence of an open-mouthed expression, often associated with surprise or astonishment. Due to its rarity, it is unlikely to be encountered frequently and is more likely to appear in advanced literary contexts. Understanding the root word \"gaping\" is essential for comprehending the meaning of \"ungaping.\""},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"Her face was calm and ungaping, betraying none of the fear she felt inside.","translation":"彼女の顔は穏やかで口を開けておらず、内に秘めた恐怖を全く表していなかった。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"口を開けていない"},{"sentence":"He forced himself to ungaping his mouth, determined to speak clearly.","translation":"彼ははっきりと話そうと決意し、無理やり口を閉じた。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"口を閉じさせる"},{"sentence":"The statue's ungaping expression gave it an air of serene contemplation.","translation":"その像の口を開けていない表情は、穏やかな瞑想の雰囲気を醸し出していた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"口を開けていない"}]}

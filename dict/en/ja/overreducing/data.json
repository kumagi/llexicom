It describes the process of reducing a substance beyond its intended or optimal state. Understanding this term requires a solid foundation in chemical principles, particularly redox reactions. The prefix 'over-' indicates that the reduction process has been carried out to an excessive degree, often leading to undesirable outcomes. It's important to note that while 'over-reducing' (with a hyphen) might be used in more general contexts to describe excessive reduction, 'overreducing' is specifically used in technical and scientific discussions.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The experiment failed because the technician accidentally overreduced the copper ions.","translation":"実験は、技術者が誤って銅イオンを過剰還元したために失敗した。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"chemistry"},{"sentence":"Overreducing the catalyst can decrease its efficiency.","translation":"触媒を過剰還元すると、その効率が低下する可能性がある。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"chemistry"}]}

It describes a complex geometrical concept related to the path traced by the instantaneous axis of rotation. Due to its specificity, it is rarely encountered outside of academic or research contexts. Understanding requires a strong background in mathematics and physics."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The shape of the herpolhode depends on the moments of inertia of the rigid body.","translation":"ヘルポルホードの形状は、剛体の慣性モーメントに依存します。","type":"descriptive","meaning_category":"rigid body motion"},{"sentence":"Analyzing the herpolhode provides insights into the stability of the rotating body.","translation":"ヘルポルホードを分析することで、回転体の安定性に関する洞察が得られます。","type":"analytical","meaning_category":"rigid body motion"}]}

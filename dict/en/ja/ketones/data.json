They are important in various chemical and biological processes. In the context of human health, ketones are produced when the body doesn't have enough glucose for energy, so it breaks down stored fat instead. This process is known as ketogenesis, and the ketones produced are often referred to as 'ketone bodies'. Elevated levels of ketone bodies in the blood (ketosis) can occur in conditions like diabetes and during ketogenic diets.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Ketone is a type of organic compound.","correct":"✓ Ketones are a type of organic compound.","note":"'Ketones' is a class of compounds, so the plural form is generally used when referring to the group as a whole."},{"incorrect":"✗ Ketones are only bad for you.","correct":"✓ While high levels of ketones can be problematic, they are a natural byproduct of fat metabolism.","note":"Ketones themselves aren't inherently bad, but excessively high levels can indicate underlying health issues."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["ketogenesis","ketogenic","ketoacidosis"],"phrasal_verbs":[],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"B2","frequency_google_ngram":"Relatively infrequent but common in scientific contexts.","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"The word 'ketones' refers to a specific category of organic chemical compounds.

A file extension is a suffix at the end of a filename that indicates the file type. For example, '.txt' for text files, '.jpg' for JPEG image files, and '.exe' for executable files.

The word is formed by adding the suffix '-less' (meaning 'without') to 'extension'. It's not a commonly used word in everyday conversation but is relevant in technical discussions about file management.","priority":"★★★"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The security software flagged the extensionless executable.","translation":"セキュリティソフトウェアは、拡張子のない実行可能ファイルにフラグを立てました。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"拡張子のない"},{"sentence":"Opening an extensionless can be risky if its true type is unknown.","translation":"拡張子のないファイルを開くことは、その本当のタイプが不明な場合、危険な可能性があります。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"拡張子のないファイル"}]}

Its primary function is to amplify weak signals while adding as little noise as possible. This is crucial for improving the overall sensitivity and performance of the system, especially in environments with high levels of interference or when dealing with very weak signals.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The pre-receiver was installed after the main receiver.","correct":"✓ The prereceiver was installed before the main receiver.","note":"A prereceiver is always installed *before* the main receiver to amplify the signal before it undergoes further processing."}],"priority":"★☆☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["preamplification","receiver","amplifier"],"related_terms":["low-noise amplifier (LNA)","signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)","front-end amplifier"],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"The term 'prereceiver' refers to a specialized electronic component used in telecommunications.

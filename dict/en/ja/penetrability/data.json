It can describe the physical properties of materials (e.g., how easily a liquid passes through a filter) or the accessibility of ideas (e.g., how easy it is to understand a concept).

It's often used in technical or scientific discussions to describe the properties of materials or systems. For example, you might talk about the 'penetrability' of a security system to describe how easily it can be breached, or the 'penetrability' of a soil to describe how easily water can pass through it. When talking about how easy something is to understand, words like 'comprehensibility' or 'accessibility' are often better choices.","priority":"★☆☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The high penetrability of the new bullet design made it extremely dangerous.","translation":"新しい銃弾設計の高い貫通性により、それは非常に危険になった。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"貫通性"},{"sentence":"Scientists studied the penetrability of the cell membrane to different substances.","translation":"科学者たちは、さまざまな物質に対する細胞膜の透過性を研究した。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"透過性"},{"sentence":"The author aimed for high penetrability in his writing, ensuring that even complex ideas were easy to grasp.","translation":"著者は、複雑なアイデアでさえ理解しやすいように、彼の文章で高い理解されやすさを目指した。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"理解されやすさ"}]}

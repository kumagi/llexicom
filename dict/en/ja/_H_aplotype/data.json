These loci are often physically close to each other on the chromosome, and the combination of alleles tends to be passed down as a unit from parent to offspring. Haplotypes are important in genetics because they can be used to trace ancestry, identify disease-causing genes, and understand population structure. Haplotype analysis involves studying the patterns of genetic variation within a population to identify common haplotypes and their frequencies.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Haplotype is the same as genotype.","correct":"✓ Haplotype is a set of alleles inherited together, while genotype is the genetic makeup of an individual at one or more specific loci.","note":"Haplotype refers to a set of linked alleles, while genotype refers to the specific alleles present at a particular locus or set of loci.

Imagine a chromosome as a long string of beads, where each bead represents a gene. A haplotype is a specific combination of these beads that tends to stay together as it's passed down from parents to children. Scientists use haplotypes to study human ancestry, understand how diseases are inherited, and learn about the genetic structure of populations. Analyzing haplotypes involves looking at patterns of genetic differences to find common combinations and how often they appear in different groups of people.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The study examined the distribution of haplotypes in different ethnic groups.","translation":"その研究では、異なる民族グループにおけるハプロタイプの分布を調査しました。","type":"scientific","meaning_category":"ハプロタイプ"},{"sentence":"Researchers are using haplotype mapping to identify genes associated with specific traits.","translation":"研究者たちは、特定の特性に関連する遺伝子を特定するためにハプロタイプマッピングを使用しています。","type":"scientific","meaning_category":"ハプロタイプ"},{"sentence":"Haplotype diversity is higher in Africa than in other continents.","translation":"ハプロタイプの多様性は、他の大陸よりもアフリカで高いです。","type":"scientific","meaning_category":"ハプロタイプ"}]}

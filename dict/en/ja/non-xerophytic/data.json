It is used to describe plants that are not adapted to dry environments. Understanding this term requires knowledge of basic botanical terminology, particularly the meaning of 'xerophyte' (a plant adapted to dry conditions). The prefix 'non-' simply negates the meaning of 'xerophytic', indicating the plant is not drought-tolerant.

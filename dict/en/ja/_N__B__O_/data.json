It refers to oxygen atoms in a silicate network that are bonded to only one silicon atom, rather than bridging between two silicon atoms. The presence and concentration of NBOs can significantly influence the properties of silicate materials, such as their viscosity, chemical durability, and optical characteristics.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{},"related_words":{"derivatives":[],"related_terms":["silicate","bridging oxygen","network modifier"],"priority":"★★★"},"level_frequency":{"frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency.","priority":"★★★"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C2","text":"'NBO' stands for 'Non-Bridging Oxygen'. It's a term used in chemistry, especially when talking about silicate materials like glass. Imagine a network of silicon and oxygen atoms. Some oxygen atoms connect two silicon atoms – these are 'bridging' oxygens. An NBO, on the other hand, is an oxygen atom that's only connected to one silicon atom. The amount of NBOs in a material can change its properties, like how strong it is or how it reacts with chemicals. This term is quite specialized and you'll mostly find it in scientific papers or textbooks about materials science."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The number of NBOs increases with the addition of network modifiers.","translation":"ネットワーク修飾剤の添加に伴い、非架橋酸素の数が増加する。","type":"scientific","meaning_category":"chemistry"},{"sentence":"NBOs contribute to the lower viscosity of the molten glass.","translation":"非架橋酸素は、溶融ガラスの低粘度に寄与する。","type":"scientific","meaning_category":"chemistry"}]}

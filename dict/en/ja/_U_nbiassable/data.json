'Biassable' itself is formed from 'bias' (a tendency to favor one thing over another) and '-able'. Therefore, 'unbiassable' literally means 'not capable of being biased'.","priority":"★☆☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/ʌnˈbaɪəsəbəl/","syllables":"un-bi-as-sa-ble"},"inflection":{"notes":"This is an adjective, so it can be modified by adverbs (e.g., 'very unbiassable') and used in comparative constructions (e.g., 'more unbiassable')."},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Unbiassable' is a relatively uncommon word, but it is increasingly used in discussions about fairness, objectivity, and the avoidance of prejudice, especially in the context of artificial intelligence and machine learning. It emphasizes the potential or capability of something to be free from bias, rather than simply stating that it is currently unbiased. The term is often used in contrast to 'biased' or 'biassable', highlighting the effort to achieve impartiality.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The data is unbiassable.","correct":"✓ The data can be made unbiassable with proper preprocessing.","note":"Data itself isn't inherently unbiassable, but it can be preprocessed to reduce bias. It's more accurate to say that a process or algorithm is unbiassable (capable of being made unbiased)."},{"incorrect":"✗ He is an unbiassable person because he always agrees with me.","correct":"✓ He is an agreeable person, but that doesn't necessarily make him unbiassable.","note":"Agreement doesn't equal lack of bias.

It describes something that has the potential to be free from bias, meaning it can be made fair and impartial. This word is not commonly used in everyday conversation and requires a good understanding of the concept of bias and its implications. It's important to distinguish it from 'unbiased,' which means currently free from bias. 'Unbiassable' suggests the capacity for achieving that state.","priority":"★☆☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The company is committed to developing an unbiassable hiring process.","translation":"その会社は、偏見のない採用プロセスを開発することに尽力している。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"fair and impartial"},{"sentence":"Researchers are working to create unbiassable algorithms for medical diagnosis.","translation":"研究者たちは、医療診断のための偏りのないアルゴリズムを作成するために取り組んでいる。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"able to be made fair and impartial"},{"sentence":"It is crucial to ensure that AI systems are as unbiassable as possible to avoid perpetuating societal inequalities.","translation":"社会的不平等を永続させないために、AIシステムが可能な限り偏見を持たないようにすることが重要だ。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"able to be made fair and impartial"},{"sentence":"The committee sought an unbiassable mediator to resolve the dispute.","translation":"委員会は、紛争を解決するために偏見を持たない調停者を求めた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"fair and impartial"}]}

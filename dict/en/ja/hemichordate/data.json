They are deuterostomes, meaning that during embryonic development, the anus forms before the mouth, a characteristic shared with chordates (animals with a spinal cord) and echinoderms (such as starfish and sea urchins). Hemichordates are important in evolutionary biology because they share some features with chordates, such as gill slits, but lack a true notochord. This makes them useful for studying the origins of chordates.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Hemichordates are vertebrates.","correct":"✓ Hemichordates are invertebrates.","note":"Hemichordates are invertebrates, lacking a backbone.

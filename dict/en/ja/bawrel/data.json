It is equivalent to the standard English word 'barrel,' which refers to a cylindrical container, often made of wood, used for storing liquids such as whisky or beer. Due to its dialectal nature, it is unlikely to be encountered in general English texts or conversations outside of Scotland."},"example_sentences":[]}

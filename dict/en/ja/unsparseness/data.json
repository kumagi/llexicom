It is the opposite of \"sparseness\" or \"sparsity,\" which refers to a state where many elements in a dataset or matrix are zero. High unsparseness implies that the dataset or matrix contains a significant proportion of non-zero elements.

It describes how much data is *not* sparse, meaning how many of the values are *not* zero. If something has high \"unsparseness,\" it means it's quite full of data and doesn't have many empty spots. This is the opposite of \"sparseness,\" which means there are many empty or zero values. Understanding this word is useful when dealing with large datasets and algorithms that rely on data density.","example_sentences":[]},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The **unsparseness** of the image data made it difficult to compress efficiently.","translation":"画像データの非疎性のため、効率的に圧縮することが困難でした。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"non-sparsity"}]}

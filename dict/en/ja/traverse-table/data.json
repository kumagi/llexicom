It provides pre-calculated values for sine and cosine functions for various angles, allowing surveyors to quickly determine the easting and northing components of a line based on its measured length and bearing. While now largely replaced by electronic calculators and software, traverse-tables were historically essential tools.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ traverse table","correct":"✓ traverse-table","note":"While 'traverse table' is sometimes used, 'traverse-table' is the more formal and precise term."}],"priority":"★☆☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["traverse","table"],"phrasal_verbs":[],"priority":"★☆☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"N/A","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"The term 'traverse-table' is specific to the fields of surveying and navigation.

It refers specifically to the number of arguments (or actants) that a predicate (typically a verb, but also adjectives and nouns) requires. A verb like 'sleep' is considered to have an adicity of 1 (unary), as it only requires one argument (the sleeper). A verb like 'hit' has an adicity of 2 (binary), requiring a hitter and something that is hit. A verb like 'give' has an adicity of 3 (ternary), requiring a giver, a recipient, and a gift. The concept of adicity is closely related to valence, which describes the capacity of a predicate to combine with a certain number and type of arguments.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The adicity of 'rain' is zero because it doesn't have any arguments.","correct":"✓ The verb 'rain' is considered a zero-adic verb because it doesn't require any overt arguments.","note":"While 'rain' doesn't have explicit arguments, in linguistic theory, it's often treated as a zero-adic verb, meaning it has no arguments that need to be overtly expressed.

It is used to describe something that *appears* to be made in a careless or untidy way. The word combines 'slovenly' (meaning careless and untidy), 'made' (referring to something that has been constructed), and 'seeming' (meaning appearing to be). It is not a common word and would likely only be used in specific contexts where the appearance of careless construction is relevant.

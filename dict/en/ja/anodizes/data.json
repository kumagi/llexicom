This process is commonly applied to aluminum, but can also be used for titanium, zinc, and magnesium. The resulting oxide layer is much stronger and more resistant to corrosion and wear than the naturally occurring oxide layer.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The metal was anodized by painting it.","correct":"✓ The metal was anodized using an electrolytic process.","note":"Anodizing is an electrochemical process, not a painting process."},{"incorrect":"✗ Anodizing is only for steel.","correct":"✓ Anodizing is commonly used for aluminum, but can also be applied to other metals.","note":"While possible, anodizing steel is not common."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["anodization (noun)","anodized (adjective)"],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Anodize' is a technical term used in materials science and engineering.

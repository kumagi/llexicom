As an adjective, it describes something that is obtained for temporary use in exchange for payment (e.g., 'a rented car'). As the past tense and past participle of the verb 'rent,' it indicates the action of obtaining something for temporary use or providing something for temporary use in exchange for payment (e.g., 'We rented an apartment,' 'They rented out their house').","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ I am living in rent apartment.","correct":"✓ I am living in a rented apartment.","note":"When using 'rented' as an adjective, it should precede the noun it modifies.

This concept is foundational to understanding how early computer systems managed data across distances. While less commonly used today, the term is important for historical context in computing and networking. It is relevant for those studying computer science, information technology, or the history of computing. The term implies a centralized processing model with remote terminals or devices accessing the central system. Understanding teleprocessing helps in grasping the evolution of distributed computing and modern cloud-based systems."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The bank used a teleprocessing system to manage transactions from its branch offices.","translation":"その銀行は、支店からの取引を管理するためにテレプロセッシングシステムを使用していました。","type":"general","meaning_category":"remote data processing"},{"sentence":"Real-time teleprocessing allowed for immediate updates to the inventory database.","translation":"リアルタイムテレプロセッシングにより、在庫データベースを即座に更新することができました。","type":"specific","meaning_category":"real-time data management"}]}

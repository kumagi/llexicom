It is often used in industries where oil and water need to be separated, such as in oil refining or wastewater treatment. A substance with high de-emulsibility separates easily, while one with low de-emulsibility tends to stay mixed. This term is not commonly used in everyday conversation and is mainly found in scientific or industrial contexts."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The lubricant's de-emulsibility was tested to ensure efficient water separation.","translation":"潤滑油の脱乳化性を試験し、効率的な水分離を保証しました。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"脱乳化性"},{"sentence":"Adding a de-emulsifier improved the de-emulsibility of the crude oil.","translation":"脱乳化剤を加えることで、原油の脱乳化性が向上しました。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"脱乳化性"}]}

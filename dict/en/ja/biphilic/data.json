In scientific contexts, particularly in chemistry and materials science, it describes substances that exhibit both hydrophilic (water-attracting) and lipophilic (fat-attracting) properties. These substances are also commonly referred to as 'amphiphilic' or 'amphipathic'. In the context of human sexuality, 'biphilic' is used as a synonym for 'bisexual', describing individuals who are attracted to both men and women.

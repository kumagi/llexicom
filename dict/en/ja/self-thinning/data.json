As plants grow and become more crowded, the weaker individuals die off, allowing the stronger ones to thrive. This phenomenon is often quantified using the 'self-thinning rule,' which relates the average size of plants to the density of the population. Understanding self-thinning is important for managing plant populations and predicting how they will respond to changes in environmental conditions."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The forest stand exhibited significant self-thinning after reaching a certain density.","translation":"その森林は、ある密度に達した後、顕著な自己間引きを示した。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"自己間引き"},{"sentence":"Self-thinning is a key factor in the dynamics of plant populations.","translation":"自己間引きは、植物個体群の動態における重要な要素である。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"自己間引き"},{"sentence":"The self-thinning exponent provides insights into the intensity of competition.","translation":"自己間引き指数は、競争の激しさに関する洞察を提供する。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"自己間引きの"}]}

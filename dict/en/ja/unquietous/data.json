It's formed by adding the prefix \"un-\" to \"quietous,\" which itself is not a very common word. The word is used to describe something that lacks peace or tranquility, whether it's a person, a place, or a situation. Due to its rarity, it's more likely to be encountered in older literature or formal writing. In modern English, words like \"restless,\" \"turbulent,\" or \"agitated\" are more frequently used to convey a similar meaning."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The unquietous child fidgeted in his seat during the long sermon.","translation":"落ち着きのない子供は、長い説教の間、席でもじもじしていた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"落ち着きのない"},{"sentence":"The unquietous atmosphere in the city made it hard to relax.","translation":"都市の騒々しい雰囲気は、リラックスすることを困難にした。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"騒々しい"},{"sentence":"She had an unquietous feeling that something was wrong.","translation":"彼女は何かおかしいという不安な気持ちを抱いていた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"不安な"}]}

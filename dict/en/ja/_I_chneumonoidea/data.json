Due to its highly technical nature, the term is primarily encountered in scientific literature, entomological studies, and discussions related to biological pest control. Understanding this term requires familiarity with biological classification systems and entomological terminology. The ecological significance of Ichneumonoidea lies in their role as natural enemies of other insects, making them important in regulating ecosystems and agricultural pest management. The two major families within this superfamily are Ichneumonidae (ichneumon wasps) and Braconidae (braconid wasps)."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"Studies on Ichneumonoidea are crucial for understanding biological control mechanisms.","translation":"ヒメバチ上科の研究は、生物的防除のメカニズムを理解するために重要です。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"Taxonomy"},{"sentence":"Ichneumonoidea wasps parasitize a wide range of insect hosts.","translation":"ヒメバチ上科のハチは、広範囲の昆虫の宿主に寄生します。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"Ecology"}]}

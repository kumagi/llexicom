It simply means 'not anemic.' It is formed by adding the prefix 'non-' to 'anemic,' which means suffering from anemia. To understand this word, you need to know what anemia is (a condition where you lack enough healthy red blood cells to carry adequate oxygen to your body's tissues). If someone is described as \"nonanemic,\" it means they do not have this condition. It is most often used in medical reports or discussions about health.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The study compared the iron levels in anemic and nonanemic participants.","translation":"その研究では、貧血の参加者と貧血でない参加者の鉄分レベルが比較された。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"Medical Condition"},{"sentence":"The doctor confirmed that the patient was nonanemic after reviewing the lab results.","translation":"医師は検査結果を確認した後、患者が貧血ではないことを確認した。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"Medical Condition"}]}

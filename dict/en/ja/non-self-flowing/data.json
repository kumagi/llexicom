It indicates that external force, such as vibration, pumping, or spreading, is necessary for the material to be properly placed or transported. The opposite of 'non-self-flowing' is 'self-flowing,' which describes materials that easily spread or level themselves without external assistance.","priority":"★★☆"}}],"etymology":{"value":"Formed by adding the prefix 'non-' (meaning 'not') to the compound word 'self-flowing'.

It is commonly used in fields like construction and engineering. If a material is described as 'non-self-flowing,' it means that you will need to use some kind of force or tool to move it or spread it out. This is different from 'self-flowing' materials, which will spread out on their own. Understanding this term requires some familiarity with technical language.

It's not a commonly used word, so it's more likely to be found in descriptive writing where the author wants to emphasize the presence of foam or bubbles. It is derived from the word 'foam' and the suffix '-ing' (to make it an adjective 'foaming') and then '-ly' to make it an adverb. The word is relatively straightforward in its meaning, but its infrequent use makes it more appropriate for advanced learners or native speakers aiming for a more descriptive style."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The detergent reacted with the water, bubbling foamingly in the sink.","translation":"洗剤は水と反応し、シンクの中で泡立ちながら泡立った。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"泡立って"},{"sentence":"The river rushed foamingly over the rocks after the heavy rain.","translation":"大雨の後、川は泡を立てながら岩の上を勢いよく流れた。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"泡立って"}]}

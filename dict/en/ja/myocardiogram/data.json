It is often performed under both rest and stress conditions (exercise or pharmacological stress) to identify areas of the heart that may not be receiving enough blood due to narrowed or blocked arteries. The terms 'myocardial perfusion scan,' 'cardiac SPECT,' and 'cardiac PET' are often used interchangeably, though they may refer to slightly different techniques or technologies.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The doctor ordered a electrocardiogram to check the blood flow to my heart.","correct":"✓ The doctor ordered a myocardiogram to check the blood flow to my heart.","note":"An electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) measures the electrical activity of the heart, while a myocardiogram assesses blood flow to the heart muscle."}],"priority":"★☆☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["myocardial","cardiogram","angiogram","echocardiogram"],"medical_terms":["ischemia","infarction","coronary artery disease","perfusion","SPECT","PET"],"priority":"★☆☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2 (specialized medical vocabulary)","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"A **myocardiogram** is a medical test that creates pictures of your heart muscle to see how well blood is flowing to it.

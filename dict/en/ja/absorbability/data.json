It is often used in scientific or technical contexts to describe the properties of materials or the processes by which substances are taken into other substances or organisms. The word implies a capability or potential for absorption, rather than the act of absorbing itself. It can also be used in a more abstract sense to describe someone's ability to understand and assimilate new information. Due to its technical nature and relatively low frequency, it is generally considered a C1 level word."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The soil's absorbability is crucial for plant growth.","translation":"土壌の吸収性は植物の成長にとって重要です。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"material property"},{"sentence":"The high absorbability of this sponge makes it ideal for cleaning.","translation":"このスポンジの高い吸収性は、掃除に最適です。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"material property"},{"sentence":"The student's remarkable absorbability allowed her to quickly master the new subject.","translation":"その学生の目覚ましい理解力のおかげで、彼女は新しい科目をすぐに習得することができました。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"cognitive ability"}]}

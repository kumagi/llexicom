It's used to describe something that is displeasing to the senses or lacks artistic merit. Because it's not a common word, it's more likely to be found in writing about art, design, or architecture, rather than in everyday conversation. It is formed by adding the prefix 'in-' (meaning 'not') to the word 'aesthetic'.

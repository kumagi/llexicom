Understanding this word requires familiarity with the root word 'abdicate,' which means to formally relinquish power or responsibility. The prefix 'non-' negates this action, indicating a refusal to relinquish such power or duty. Its usage is generally restricted to contexts where the deliberate choice not to abdicate is a significant aspect of the discussion."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The CEO's nonabdicative approach ensured stability during the company's restructuring.","translation":"CEOの譲位しないアプローチは、会社の再編中に安定を確保した。","type":"general","meaning_category":"leadership"},{"sentence":"A nonabdicative parent remains involved in their child's life, offering guidance and support.","translation":"譲位しない親は、子供の生活に関わり続け、指導とサポートを提供する。","type":"general","meaning_category":"responsibility"}]}

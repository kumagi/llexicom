It describes something (usually a cell, virus, or organism) that has a problem with its RNA. RNA is a molecule essential for various biological processes, including protein synthesis. If something is \"RNA-defective,\" it means that its RNA is not functioning properly, which can lead to various problems. This term is mainly found in scientific papers and textbooks related to these fields."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The researchers created an RNA-defective mutant to study the effects on protein expression.","translation":"研究者たちはタンパク質発現への影響を研究するために、RNA機能不全の変異体を作成した。","type":"general","meaning_category":"general"},{"sentence":"An RNA-defective virus may be less virulent due to its impaired ability to replicate.","translation":"RNA機能不全のウイルスは、複製能力が損なわれているため、毒性が低い可能性がある。","type":"virology","meaning_category":"virology"}]}

This is often a concern in embedded systems, mobile devices, or older computers. When developing software for such environments, programmers must be careful to use memory efficiently to avoid running out of memory and causing the program to crash or perform poorly. Optimization techniques like reducing data structures, using efficient algorithms, and careful memory management are crucial in memory-constrained environments."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"Developing for **memory-constrained** devices requires careful optimization.","translation":"メモリ制約のあるデバイス向けの開発には、慎重な最適化が必要です。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"limited memory"},{"sentence":"The operating system is designed to be lightweight for **memory-constrained** embedded systems.","translation":"このオペレーティングシステムは、メモリ制約のある組み込みシステム向けに軽量になるように設計されています。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"limited memory"}]}

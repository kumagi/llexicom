It's used in fields like materials science and engineering to indicate that a material will degrade or be damaged when exposed to UV light. This term implies that the material lacks additives or inherent properties that would protect it from UV degradation. Therefore, it is unsuitable for outdoor applications without additional protection. Understanding this term is important when selecting materials for products that will be used outdoors or exposed to UV light sources."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The manufacturer warned that the product's casing was non-UV-stable and would fade if left in direct sunlight.","translation":"製造業者は、製品の筐体が紫外線安定性を持たず、直射日光にさらされると色あせると警告しました。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"紫外線安定性がない"},{"sentence":"Due to the non-UV-stable nature of the film, it is recommended to apply a protective laminate.","translation":"フィルムが耐紫外線性を持たないため、保護ラミネートを適用することをお勧めします。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"耐紫外線性がない"}]}

They are generally unstable and often explosive. The simplest diazoalkane is diazomethane (CH₂N₂), which is a commonly used reagent in organic synthesis. Diazoalkanes are used in various chemical reactions, including cyclopropanation, Wolff rearrangement, and as carbene precursors.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{},"related_words":{"derivatives":["diazomethane","diazo compound"],"related_terms":["alkane","diazo group","carbene"],"priority":"★★★"},"level_frequency":{},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Diazoalkane' is a technical term in organic chemistry, referring to a specific class of organic compounds.

It describes the property of certain minerals to display different colors when viewed under polarized light from different angles. This phenomenon is due to the varying absorption of light along different crystallographic axes within the mineral's structure. It is an advanced concept typically encountered in higher-level science courses or technical literature."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"Under the microscope, the tourmaline crystal appeared strongly pleochroitic.","translation":"顕微鏡下では、そのトルマリン結晶は強い多色性を示した。","type":"general","meaning_category":"mineralogy"},{"sentence":"The gemstone's pleochroitic effect made it highly prized by collectors.","translation":"その宝石の多色性効果は、収集家たちに高く評価された。","type":"general","meaning_category":"gemology"}]}

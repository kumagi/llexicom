The Markov property states that the future state of a process depends only on its present state, not on the sequence of events that preceded it (its 'history'). Therefore, a non-Markovian process *does* depend on its past. These processes are more complex to model than Markovian ones.","priority":"★★★"},"level_frequency":{"frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency - primarily used in technical and scientific contexts.","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Non-Markovian' is a technical term used in mathematics, physics, and related fields.

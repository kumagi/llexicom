It describes the process of correcting chromatic aberration in lenses or optical systems. Chromatic aberration occurs when a lens fails to focus all colors to the same point, resulting in color fringes or blurring. Achromatizing involves using multiple lens elements made of different materials to counteract this effect. Understanding this term requires a background in physics or optics.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The telescope manufacturer is focusing on achromatizing their new line of lenses.","translation":"その望遠鏡メーカーは、新しいレンズラインの色消し処理に力を入れています。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"色収差補正"},{"sentence":"By achromatizing the lens system, they were able to produce a sharper image.","translation":"レンズシステムを色消し処理することにより、より鮮明な画像を生成することができました。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"色収差補正"}]}

In a philosophical context, it meant 'to represent in an instance.' Its use in computer science, particularly object-oriented programming, emerged in the latter half of the 20th century to describe the creation of a specific object from a class.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/ɪnˈstænʃieɪtɪŋ/","syllables":"in-stan-shi-a-ting"},"inflection":{"verb_forms":{"present_simple":["instantiate","instantiates"],"past_simple":"instantiated","past_participle":"instantiated","present_participle":"instantiating"}},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Instantiating' is primarily used in the context of object-oriented programming. It refers to the process of creating a specific instance (object) of a class. A class serves as a blueprint or template, and instantiating it creates a concrete object with its own unique state (attributes) and behavior (methods). The term emphasizes the transition from an abstract definition (the class) to a tangible, usable entity (the object). It's a fundamental concept in languages like Java, C++, Python, and C#.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ I'm instancing the class.","correct":"✓ I'm instantiating the class.","note":"'Instancing' is sometimes used informally, but 'instantiating' is the more correct and widely accepted term in programming contexts."},{"incorrect":"✗ The object is instance.","correct":"✓ The object is an instance.","note":"'Instance' is a noun, and requires an article ('a' or 'an') when referring to a single object."},{"incorrect":"✗ We instantiated the class with no arguments, so it's null.","correct":"✓ We instantiated the class with no arguments, so its attributes have default values.","note":"Instantiating a class will create an object, even if no arguments are passed.

It describes the process of creating a real, usable object from a class, which is like a blueprint. If you understand the concepts of classes and objects in programming, then understanding 'instantiating' is simply recognizing the action of bringing a class to life as a functioning object in memory. It's not a word used in everyday conversation, but it's crucial for programmers working with object-oriented languages.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The code is responsible for **instantiating** the user interface elements.","translation":"そのコードは、ユーザーインターフェース要素をインスタンス化する役割を担っています。","type":"verb (present participle)","meaning_category":"creating objects"},{"sentence":"Before **instantiating** the database connection, check the configuration file.","translation":"データベース接続をインスタンス化する前に、構成ファイルを確認してください。","type":"verb (gerund)","meaning_category":"creating objects"},{"sentence":"We are currently **instantiating** thousands of objects to simulate the system's behavior.","translation":"現在、システムの動作をシミュレートするために、数千のオブジェクトをインスタンス化しています。","type":"verb (present participle)","meaning_category":"creating objects"}]}

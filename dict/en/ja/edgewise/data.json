It means to try to say something when someone else is talking a lot and not giving you a chance to speak. The word itself means 'with the edge forward' or 'sideways', so you can imagine trying to squeeze something through a narrow space by turning it to its edge. It is more commonly used in the idiom than as a standalone adverb.

'Anneal' comes from Old English 'onǣlan' meaning 'to set on fire, kindle, bake, burn,' related to 'āl' meaning 'fire.'

This process results in a very soft and ductile metal, free from internal stresses and work hardening. It's often used when the metal needs to undergo significant deformation or forming.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ dead anneal","correct":"✓ dead-anneal","note":"It is usually written with a hyphen."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["anneal","annealing"],"phrasal_verbs":[],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"N/A","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency - Technical term.","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Dead-anneal' is a technical term used in metallurgy and materials science.

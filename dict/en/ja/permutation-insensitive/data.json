For example, when comparing two sets, the order of elements is irrelevant; only the presence or absence of elements matters. Hashing algorithms designed to be permutation-insensitive are useful in scenarios where the input data may be presented in different orders but should still produce the same hash value.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ permutation insensitive","correct":"✓ permutation-insensitive","note":"The hyphen is important to properly connect the terms and indicate that 'insensitive' modifies the entire phrase 'permutation'."}],"priority":"★☆☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":[],"phrasal_verbs":[],"related_terms":["permutation","insensitive","order-independent","order-dependent"]},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency - technical term.","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Permutation-insensitive' is a technical term used in fields like computer science and mathematics.

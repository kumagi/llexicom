It refers to the degree to which a person can separate their intellect from their emotions, and themselves from their family of origin. A well-differentiated person can maintain a clear sense of self and make decisions based on reason, even in the face of emotional pressure. Conversely, a poorly differentiated person is more likely to be reactive, anxious, and emotionally dependent on others.

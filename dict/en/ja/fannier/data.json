Its meaning is highly context-dependent due to the varied meanings of 'fanny' in different dialects. In American English, where 'fanny' refers to buttocks, 'fannier' would imply something is more like buttocks. In British English, where 'fanny' is a vulgar term for female genitalia, 'fannier' would be highly inappropriate in most contexts. The word can also relate to enthusiasm, implying 'more enthusiastic' or 'more like a fan' of something. Due to the potential for misinterpretation, it's best to use alternative, clearer words unless the context is very specific."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"This version of the character design is fannier than the original.","translation":"このキャラクターデザインのバージョンは、オリジナルよりもお尻っぽい。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"お尻のような (buttocks-like)"},{"sentence":"The crowd grew fannier as the band played their most popular song.","translation":"バンドが最も人気のある曲を演奏するにつれて、観客はより熱狂的になった。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"より熱狂的な"}]}

It is not commonly used in everyday conversation and is more likely to be encountered in academic or artistic contexts when discussing the representation of the human body. The term implies a degree of intentionality or design in the partial exposure, distinguishing it from simply being undressed. Understanding the prefix 'demi-' (meaning 'half' or 'partial') is helpful in grasping the word's meaning.","example_sentences":[]}}

It is generally used for slower to moderate tempos, where a single, clear articulation is desired for each note. For faster passages, double-tonguing or triple-tonguing are often employed.

It refers to a way of playing notes by using your tongue to stop and start the airflow for each note. Imagine saying 'tuh' or 'dah' for each note you play. This technique is usually used for slower or medium-speed music. For faster music, musicians often use 'double-tonguing' or 'triple-tonguing,' which are faster ways to play notes. So, if you hear someone talking about 'single-tonguing,' they're talking about this basic way of playing notes on a wind instrument."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The student practiced single-tonguing to improve the clarity of his trumpet playing.","translation":"学生はトランペット演奏の明瞭さを向上させるためにシングルタンギングを練習した。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"technique"},{"sentence":"She can single-tongue quite rapidly, but prefers double-tonguing for extremely fast passages.","translation":"彼女はかなり速くシングルタンギングできるが、非常に速いパッセージではダブルタンギングを好む。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"perform"}]}

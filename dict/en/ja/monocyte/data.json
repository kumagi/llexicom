They circulate in the blood and then migrate into tissues, where they differentiate into macrophages or dendritic cells. Macrophages are phagocytic cells that engulf and digest cellular debris and pathogens. Dendritic cells are antigen-presenting cells that activate T cells. Monocyte counts are often measured in blood tests to assess immune function and detect inflammation or infection.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Monocytes are a type of red blood cell.","correct":"✓ Monocytes are a type of white blood cell.","note":"Monocytes are leukocytes, which are white blood cells, not erythrocytes (red blood cells)."},{"incorrect":"✗ Monocyte is a bacteria.","correct":"✓ A monocyte is a type of cell.","note":"Monocytes are cells, not microorganisms like bacteria."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["monocytic (adjective)","monocytopoiesis (noun)"],"phrasal_verbs":[],"priority":"★★★"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C1","frequency_google_ngram":"Relatively low frequency, primarily used in medical and scientific contexts.","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Monocyte' is a technical term used in biology and medicine.

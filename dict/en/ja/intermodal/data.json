In the context of transportation, it refers to the use of multiple modes of transport (e.g., ship, rail, truck) to move goods from origin to destination. This is often associated with containerization, where goods are loaded into standardized containers that can be easily transferred between different modes. In psychology and neuroscience, \"intermodal\" refers to the integration of information from different sensory modalities (e.g., vision, hearing, touch). This is important for perception, learning, and cognitive development.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The company uses a multimodal container.","correct":"✓ The company uses an intermodal container.","note":"While \"multimodal\" and \"intermodal\" are sometimes used interchangeably, \"intermodal\" is more precise when referring to the coordinated use of different transport modes under a single contract.

In transportation, it means using different ways to move goods, like ships, trains, and trucks, all working together. For example, an intermodal container can be moved easily from a ship to a train. In sensory perception, it means using more than one sense at the same time, like seeing and hearing. For instance, intermodal perception helps us understand speech better when we can see the speaker's face.

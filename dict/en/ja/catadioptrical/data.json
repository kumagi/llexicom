These systems are often used to create compact, high-magnification lenses, especially in telescopes and camera lenses. The combination of refraction and reflection allows for correction of optical aberrations and a longer focal length in a shorter physical space.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The catadioptric lens was very expensiv.","correct":"✓ The catadioptrical lens was very expensive.","note":"Correct spelling is crucial.

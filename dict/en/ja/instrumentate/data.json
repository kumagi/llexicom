It refers to the process of adding code, sensors, or other mechanisms to a system or application to collect data about its performance, behavior, or state. This data is then used for monitoring, debugging, optimization, and other purposes. The term is less common in general-purpose English.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The musician instrumentated the song.","correct":"✓ The musician orchestrated the song.","note":"'Instrumentate' is not typically used in the context of music.

It means to add tools or code to a system (like software) so you can measure and monitor how well it's working. Think of it like adding sensors to a machine to track its temperature or speed. This helps in finding problems, improving performance, and understanding how the system behaves. It's not a common word in everyday conversation.","priority":"★★★"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The developers instrumentated the API endpoints to track response times.","translation":"開発者は、応答時間を追跡するためにAPIエンドポイントを計測可能にしました。","type":"verb (vt)","meaning_category":"計測可能にする"},{"sentence":"Proper instrumentation is crucial for effective performance monitoring.","translation":"効果的なパフォーマンス監視には、適切な計測が不可欠です。","type":"related_word (instrumentation)","meaning_category":"計測"},{"sentence":"We instrumentated the database queries to identify slow-performing queries.","translation":"低速なクエリを特定するために、データベースクエリを計測可能にしました。","type":"verb (vt)","meaning_category":"計測可能にする"}]}

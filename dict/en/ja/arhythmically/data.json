It's formed by adding the prefix 'a-' (meaning 'not' or 'without') to 'rhythmically.' This word is used to describe something that doesn't follow a predictable beat or flow, often in the context of music, dance, or biological processes. Because it's a more technical term, it's less common in everyday conversation and more likely to appear in specialized or academic contexts."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The patient's heart beat arhythmically, causing concern among the medical staff.","translation":"患者の心臓は不規則に鼓動しており、医療スタッフの間で懸念を引き起こした。","type":"general","meaning_category":"irregular heartbeat"},{"sentence":"The modern dance performance featured movements that were intentionally arhythmically and disjointed.","translation":"その現代舞踊のパフォーマンスは、意図的にリズム感がなく、ばらばらの動きを特徴としていた。","type":"arts","meaning_category":"lack of rhythm in dance"},{"sentence":"The old engine sputtered arhythmically before finally stalling.","translation":"古いエンジンは最終的に停止する前に、不規則に爆発音を立てた。","type":"mechanical","meaning_category":"irregular engine function"}]}

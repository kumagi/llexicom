Evergreen trees are those that keep their leaves throughout the year, so 'evergreen-like' can describe something that has a similar quality of being long-lasting or always fresh. It's often used figuratively to describe things that remain popular or relevant over time, such as a classic song or a timeless design. Because it's a more descriptive term, it's less common than the word 'evergreen' itself, but it's useful for specifying a resemblance rather than a direct equivalence."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The garden was designed with several evergreen-like plants to provide year-round color.","translation":"その庭は、一年を通して彩りを提供するために、いくつかの常緑樹のような植物で設計されていた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"常緑樹に似た"},{"sentence":"The company aims to create products with an evergreen-like appeal that lasts for years.","translation":"その会社は、長年にわたって続く常緑樹のような魅力を持つ製品を作ることを目指している。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"不朽の"}]}

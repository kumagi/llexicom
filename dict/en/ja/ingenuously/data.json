It is important to consider the context to determine whether the word is being used in a positive or slightly critical way.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ She ingenuously thought everyone was telling the truth, she was so naive.","correct":"✓ She ingenuously thought everyone was telling the truth; she was so naive.","note":"The semicolon connects two related independent clauses.

The key distinction is between precatory language and mandatory language. Mandatory language creates a legal obligation, while precatory language does not. The presence of precatory language can be a point of contention in legal disputes, as courts must determine whether the language was intended to create a binding obligation.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The contract was precatory, so we had to follow it.","correct":"✓ The contract was mandatory, so we had to follow it. / ✓ The contract was advisory, but we chose to follow it.","note":"Precatory means non-binding, so it would not be something you *have* to follow.

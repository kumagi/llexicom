A cache is like a quick-access storage area for frequently used information. Instead of always getting information from the main source, which can be slow, the system first checks the cache. If the information is there (a 'cache hit'), it's retrieved quickly. If not (a 'cache miss'), it's retrieved from the main source and also stored in the cache for future use. This makes the system faster overall. This term is mostly used in technical contexts like computer science and web development."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The company implemented a cache-based solution to reduce server load.","translation":"その会社は、サーバーの負荷を軽減するためにキャッシュベースのソリューションを実装しました。","type":"general","meaning_category":"system"},{"sentence":"Cache-based DNS servers provide faster domain name resolution.","translation":"キャッシュベースのDNSサーバーは、より高速なドメイン名解決を提供します。","type":"technical","meaning_category":"networking"},{"sentence":"The game engine uses a cache-based rendering technique to improve frame rates.","translation":"そのゲームエンジンは、フレームレートを向上させるためにキャッシュベースのレンダリング技術を使用しています。","type":"technical","meaning_category":"computing"}]}

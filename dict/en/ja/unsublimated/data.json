'Sublimated' itself comes from the verb 'sublimate,' which is derived from the Latin word 'sublimare,' meaning 'to raise up' or 'to elevate.' In psychoanalytic terms, it refers to the process of transforming unacceptable impulses into socially acceptable actions or expressions.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/ʌnˈsʌblɪmeɪtɪd/","syllables":"un-sub-li-ma-ted"},"inflection":{"notes":"This is an adjective, so it does not inflect like a verb. It can be modified by adverbs (e.g., 'very unsublimated')."},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Unsublimated' generally describes something that has not been refined, purified, or transformed into a more socially acceptable or elevated form. In a general sense, it can refer to raw emotions, desires, or energies that have not been channeled or controlled. In psychoanalysis, it specifically refers to impulses or drives that have not been successfully sublimated, meaning they have not been redirected into socially acceptable behaviors or creative outlets. This can be seen as a negative state, as unsublimated impulses may lead to psychological distress or problematic behaviors.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The unsublimated water turned into ice.","correct":"✓ The water was not sublimated; it remained in its solid state.","note":"In physics and chemistry, sublimation refers to the transition of a substance directly from the solid to the gas phase without passing through the liquid phase. 'Unsublimated' would mean the substance did not undergo this process. The example refers to freezing, not sublimation."},{"incorrect":"✗ He felt unsublimated after the argument.","correct":"✓ He felt frustrated/angry/upset after the argument.","note":"'Unsublimated' refers to something that hasn't been transformed in a specific way, especially in a psychological sense. Simply feeling upset or angry doesn't necessarily mean something is unsublimated. It implies that the emotions have not been channeled into a more constructive outlet."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["unsublimate (verb)","sublimate (verb)","sublimation (noun)","sublimatory (adjective)"],"phrases":["unsublimated desire","unsublimated aggression","unsublimated energy"],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency.

It describes something that has not undergone sublimation, which is the process of transforming base or unacceptable impulses or desires into more socially acceptable or elevated forms. For example, unsublimated aggression might refer to raw, uncontrolled anger that hasn't been channeled into a productive activity like sports or art. Understanding this word requires familiarity with the concept of sublimation and a relatively advanced vocabulary.

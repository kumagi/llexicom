It is formed by adding the prefix \"non-\" to \"moveableness,\" indicating negation. Due to its formality and infrequent use, it is more likely to be encountered in technical or formal contexts rather than everyday conversation. Simpler alternatives like \"immobility\" or phrases like \"the inability to be moved\" are often preferred.

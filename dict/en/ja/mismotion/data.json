It is often used in technical or specialized contexts, such as robotics, sports analysis, or physical therapy, where precise movements are important. The word is formed by combining the prefix \"mis-\" (meaning wrong or incorrect) with the word \"motion\" (meaning movement). Therefore, \"mismotion\" essentially means \"wrong motion\" or \"incorrect movement.\" Because it is a specialized term, it is not typically used in everyday conversation. Instead, more common words like \"error in movement\" or \"incorrect action\" are often used. Understanding the term is helpful in specialized fields where precise movement analysis is essential."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The engineer identified a mismotion in the robotic arm's calibration sequence.","translation":"エンジニアは、ロボットアームのキャリブレーションシーケンスに誤った動きがあることを特定しました。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"不適切な動き"},{"sentence":"Physical therapists often focus on correcting mismotions to improve patients' mobility.","translation":"理学療法士は、患者の可動性を改善するために、誤った動きの修正に焦点を当てることがよくあります。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"誤った動き"},{"sentence":"High-speed cameras are used to detect and analyze subtle mismotions in athletes' techniques.","translation":"高速カメラは、アスリートのテクニックにおける微妙な誤った動きを検出および分析するために使用されます。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"運動の誤り"}]}

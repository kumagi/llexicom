It describes the infantile stage of psychosexual development, where sexual pleasure is not limited to the genitals but can be derived from various parts of the body and activities. It's important to note that 'perverse' in this context does not carry the same negative connotation as in everyday language. It simply means 'deviating from the norm' of adult genital sexuality.

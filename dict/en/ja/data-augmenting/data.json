It refers to methods that artificially increase the size of a dataset by creating modified versions of existing data. These modifications can include rotations, flips, crops, noise addition, or other transformations, depending on the type of data (e.g., images, text, audio). The goal is to improve the generalization ability and robustness of machine learning models by exposing them to a wider range of variations in the training data.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The data augmenting is very important.","correct":"✓ Data augmentation is very important.","note":"'Data augmenting' is an adjective describing a technique.

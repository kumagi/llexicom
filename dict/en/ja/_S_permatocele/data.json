It typically contains fluid and dead sperm cells. Most spermatoceles are small and cause no symptoms, so they may only be discovered during a physical exam. Larger spermatoceles can cause discomfort, pain, or a feeling of heaviness in the scrotum. Treatment is usually not necessary unless the spermatocele is causing significant symptoms. In such cases, options include pain medication, support underwear, aspiration, or surgical removal (spermatocelectomy).","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ He has a spermatic seal.","correct":"✓ He has a spermatocele.","note":"'Spermatic seal' is not a medical term.

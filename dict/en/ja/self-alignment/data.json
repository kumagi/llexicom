This concept is frequently encountered in technical fields such as engineering, robotics, and software development. Understanding the term requires familiarity with automated systems and control mechanisms. The term implies a level of autonomy where the system can correct itself without external assistance. It is important to distinguish this from manual alignment, which requires human intervention.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The new printer features automatic self-alignment of the print heads.","translation":"その新しいプリンターは、プリントヘッドの自動自己整合機能を備えています。","type":"general","meaning_category":"automatic adjustment"},{"sentence":"The satellite uses GPS and self-alignment to maintain its orbit.","translation":"その衛星は、GPSと自己整合を使用して軌道を維持します。","type":"technical","meaning_category":"position correction"},{"sentence":"The software's self-alignment feature ensures data accuracy.","translation":"そのソフトウェアの自己整合機能は、データの精度を保証します。","type":"software","meaning_category":"data correction"}]}

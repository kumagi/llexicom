As an adverb, it indicates movement or direction away from a central point or towards the outside. As an adjective, it describes something that is visible or apparent on the surface, often contrasting with inner feelings or true nature.

As an adverb, it means 'away from the center' or 'towards the outside.' As an adjective, it means 'relating to how someone or something appears to other people.' It's often used to contrast with what's happening inside or what's truly felt. For example, someone might show no \"outward\" signs of sadness, even though they are very sad inside.

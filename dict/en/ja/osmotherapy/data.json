It involves administering osmotic agents, typically mannitol or hypertonic saline, which create an osmotic gradient that draws fluid out of the brain tissue and into the bloodstream, thereby reducing swelling and pressure within the skull. This treatment is often used in acute care settings to stabilize patients and prevent further neurological damage.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ osmotherapy is a type of surgery.","correct":"✓ osmotherapy is a type of medical treatment.","note":"Osmotherapy is a medical treatment involving osmotic agents, not a surgical procedure."},{"incorrect":"✗ osmotherapy increases intracranial pressure.","correct":"✓ osmotherapy reduces intracranial pressure.","note":"The purpose of osmotherapy is to decrease, not increase, intracranial pressure."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["osmotic","osmosis","therapy"],"phrasal_verbs":[]},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"Osmotherapy is a specialized medical term referring to the therapeutic use of osmotic agents to reduce intracranial pressure.

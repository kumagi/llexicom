It describes a condition or entity that is particularly susceptible to the negative effects of lipids, such as fatty acids, cholesterol, or triglycerides. This vulnerability can manifest as increased inflammation, cellular dysfunction, or disease progression. Research into lipid vulnerability aims to identify the underlying mechanisms and develop strategies to mitigate the harmful effects of lipids in susceptible individuals or tissues.","priority":"N/A"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"The patient is lipid vulnerable.","correct":"The patient has a lipid-vulnerable condition.","note":"It's more common to say someone has a lipid-vulnerable *condition* or *phenotype* rather than saying they *are* lipid-vulnerable."}],"priority":"N/A"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["vulnerable","vulnerability","lipid","lipids","lipotoxicity","lipogenesis"],"phrasal_verbs":[],"priority":"N/A"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"N/A","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency - Primarily used in scientific and medical literature.","priority":"N/A"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C2","text":"\"Lipid-vulnerable\" is a technical term used in biology and medicine to describe something that is easily harmed by lipids (fats).

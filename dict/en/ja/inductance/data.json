It describes the opposition to changes in current flow. A larger inductance means a greater opposition to current changes. It's crucial in understanding AC circuit behavior and is used in various applications like filtering, energy storage, and impedance matching.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The inductor has a high inductivity.","correct":"✓ The inductor has a high inductance.","note":"'Inductivity' is not a standard term.

It works by storing the results of function calls based on their input parameters. When the same function is called again with the same parameters, the stored result is retrieved instead of recomputing it. This is particularly effective for functions that are computationally expensive and are called repeatedly with the same inputs. Memoization is often used in dynamic programming to solve overlapping subproblems efficiently. It differs from general caching in that it is specifically applied to function calls and their return values.","priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"technical_level":"Advanced (Computer Science)","frequency_general":"Low (General Use)","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"Difficult","text":"Memoization is a programming technique where a function 'remembers' the results of previous calculations. If you ask the function to calculate something it has already calculated before, it simply gives you the stored answer instead of recalculating it. This can make programs much faster, especially when dealing with complex or repetitive calculations. It's like having a cheat sheet for math problems you've already solved.","priority":"★☆☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"Without memoization, the Fibonacci sequence calculation can be very slow for large numbers.","translation":"メモ化がないと、フィボナッチ数列の計算は大きな数に対して非常に遅くなる可能性があります。","type":"example","meaning_category":"Performance Improvement"},{"sentence":"Memoization trades space for time by storing previously computed results.","translation":"メモ化は、以前に計算された結果を保存することで、時間と引き換えにスペースを消費します。","type":"example","meaning_category":"Trade-off"},{"sentence":"The memoization technique is commonly used in parsers and compilers.","translation":"メモ化のテクニックは、パーサーやコンパイラーで一般的に使用されています。","type":"example","meaning_category":"Application"}],"etymology":{"value":"Derived from the Latin word 'memorare' (to remember) with the suffix '-ization' indicating a process or action.

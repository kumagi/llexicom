'Cony' (also spelled 'coney') was a common term for a rabbit, considered an easy and naive target. 'Catch' refers to capturing or taking something. Thus, a 'cony-catcher' was someone who preyed on the naive, like catching rabbits. The term gained popularity through pamphlets and writings that exposed the tricks and methods used by swindlers in Elizabethan England.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/ˈkɒniˌkætʃ/","syllables":"con-y-catch"},"inflection":{"verb_forms":{"present_simple":["cony-catch"],"past_simple":"cony-caught","past_participle":"cony-caught","present_participle":"cony-catching"},"noun_plural":"cony-catches"},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Cony-catch' is an archaic term primarily used in the 16th and 17th centuries, particularly in Elizabethan and Jacobean England.

It is formed by adding the suffix '-ness' to the adjective 'rushing.' Because it is not frequently used, it is more likely to be encountered in formal writing or when a speaker wants to emphasize the abstract quality of being rushed rather than simply saying something is 'rushed' or 'in a rush.' A more common alternative is to use the noun 'rush' itself."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The constant rushingness of her job was taking a toll on her health.","translation":"仕事の絶え間ないせわしなさが彼女の健康に悪影響を及ぼしていた。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"せわしなさ"},{"sentence":"He found the rushingness of the city streets overwhelming after living in the countryside.","translation":"彼は田舎暮らしの後、都会の通りの慌ただしさに圧倒された。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"慌ただしさ"}]}

It is used to describe a look or expression in someone's eyes that is becoming more gentle or tender. The word combines the idea of 'softening' (becoming less harsh) with 'gazed' (having a steady look). Because it is a compound adjective and not a common term, it requires a good understanding of both root words and how they combine to create a specific image or feeling. It is more likely to be encountered in descriptive writing or literature.

It is formed by combining 'self-sufficient' (able to provide for oneself) with 'seeming' (appearing to be). It describes something or someone that gives the impression of being independent and able to manage without help, even if this is not entirely true. It's more nuanced than simply saying someone is 'self-sufficient' because it highlights the appearance or impression of self-sufficiency.

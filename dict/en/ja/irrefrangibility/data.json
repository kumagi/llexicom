It is most often used in scientific or philosophical contexts. It refers to the quality of something that cannot be broken, bent, or refuted. In physics, it refers to the property of a ray of light that cannot be refracted (bent) when passing through a medium. In argumentation, it refers to an argument that is so sound and well-supported that it cannot be refuted.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The irrefrangibility of the vase was surprising.","correct":"✓ The durability of the vase was surprising.","note":"'Irrefrangibility' is not typically used to describe the physical strength of an object, but rather its resistance to being broken in a specific way (e.g., light refraction). 'Durability' is a more appropriate term for general physical strength."},{"incorrect":"✗ The irrefrangibility of his feelings was evident.","correct":"✓ The intensity of his feelings was evident.","note":"'Irrefrangibility' is not usually used to describe feelings or emotions.

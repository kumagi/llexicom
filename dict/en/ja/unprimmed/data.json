It is formed by adding the prefix 'un-' to 'primmed,' which itself is the past participle of 'prime.' To understand 'unprimmed,' one must first understand 'prime' in the context of preparing something, such as a surface for painting or a pump for operation. Therefore, 'unprimmed' means 'not prepared' or 'not having had the initial preparatory steps taken.' It is most likely to be encountered in specialized fields like art or engineering."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The artist preferred to work on unprimmed linen to achieve a specific texture.","translation":"そのアーティストは、特定の質感を得るために、下地処理をしていないリネンに描くのを好んだ。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"artistic material"},{"sentence":"Starting the generator was difficult because the fuel pump was unprimmed.","translation":"燃料ポンプに呼び水がされていなかったので、発電機の始動は困難だった。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"mechanical system"}]}

However, it's important to note that 'grammatical' is a much more common and widely accepted term. 'Grammatic' is less frequently used and might sound somewhat archaic or overly formal in many contexts. Therefore, it's generally recommended to use 'grammatical' instead of 'grammatic' unless you have a specific reason to use the latter in a highly specialized context."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The teacher corrected the student's **grammatic** errors.","translation":"先生は生徒の文法的な誤りを修正した。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"文法の"},{"sentence":"Is this sentence **grammatic** according to modern English usage?","translation":"この文は現代英語の用法において文法的に正しいですか？","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"文法にかなった"}]}

This process is commonly used in the food industry to convert liquid oils into solid or semi-solid fats, such as in the production of margarine or shortening. The term \"partially hydrogenized\" is often used to indicate that the hydrogenation process is incomplete, which can result in the formation of trans fats.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The process is hydrogenized.","correct":"✓ The oil is hydrogenized.","note":"The subject of 'hydrogenized' should be the substance being treated with hydrogen, not the process itself."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["hydrogen (水素)","hydrogenation (水素化)","hydrogenize (水素化する)","hydrogenating (水素化している)"],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"\"Hydrogenized\" is a technical term used in chemistry and food science. It refers to the process of adding hydrogen to a substance, typically an oil or fat, to saturate its unsaturated chemical bonds. This process changes the physical properties of the substance, such as converting a liquid oil into a solid or semi-solid fat. The term is most commonly encountered in the context of food processing and nutrition, particularly in discussions about trans fats and the health effects of processed foods. Understanding the term requires some familiarity with basic chemistry concepts.","example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The label indicated that the product contained hydrogenized vegetable oil.","translation":"ラベルには、その製品に水素化植物油が含まれていると表示されていた。","type":"general","meaning_category":"general"},{"sentence":"The hydrogenation process converts unsaturated fats into saturated fats, resulting in a hydrogenized product.","translation":"水素化プロセスは不飽和脂肪を飽和脂肪に変換し、水素化された製品をもたらす。","type":"technical","meaning_category":"technical"}]}}

The diploid phase is reduced to the zygote, which undergoes meiosis to produce haploid spores. This contrasts with diplobiontic life cycles where both haploid and diploid multicellular stages exist.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Haplobiontic organisms have diploid dominant phase.","correct":"✓ Haplobiontic organisms have haploid dominant phase.","note":"Haplobiontic organisms are characterized by a dominant haploid phase, not diploid."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["haplont","haplotype"],"phrasal_verbs":[],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low Frequency","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"The term `haplobiontic` is a technical term used in biology, specifically in the context of life cycles of organisms such as algae and fungi. It describes organisms where the dominant phase of the life cycle is haploid, meaning they have only one set of chromosomes. This term is typically encountered in advanced biology courses or research papers. Understanding requires knowledge of basic genetics and life cycle concepts.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"Chlamydomonas exhibits a **haplobiontic** life cycle.","translation":"クラミドモナスは単相世代交代のライフサイクルを示す。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"単相世代交代の"},{"sentence":"In **haplobiontic** species, meiosis occurs after zygote formation.","translation":"単相世代交代種では、減数分裂は接合子形成後に起こる。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"単相世代交代の"},{"sentence":"The **haplobiontic** life cycle is common in many green algae.","translation":"単相世代交代のライフサイクルは多くの緑藻類に共通である。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"単相世代交代の"}]}

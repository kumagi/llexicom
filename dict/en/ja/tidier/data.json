'Tidy' means neat and organized. So, 'tidier' is used to compare two things, saying that one is more neat and organized than the other. For example, 'My room is tidier than yours' means that my room is more neat and organized than your room. It's a comparative adjective, so it's used to compare. The word 'tidy' is more common, but 'tidier' is easy to understand if you know 'tidy'."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"Her garden is much **tidier** than mine.","translation":"彼女の庭は私の庭よりもずっと整頓されている。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"more neat"},{"sentence":"He made an effort to keep his workspace **tidier**.","translation":"彼は作業スペースをよりきれいに保つように努めた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"more organized"},{"sentence":"She used a **tidier** to store her sewing supplies.","translation":"彼女は裁縫道具を収納するために整理箱を使った。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"(archaic) container"}]}

The logarithm of a number *x* with respect to base *b* is the exponent to which *b* must be raised to produce *x*. Common logarithms use base 10, while natural logarithms use the base *e* (Euler's number, approximately 2.71828). Logarithms are used in various fields, including mathematics, physics, engineering, and computer science, to simplify calculations and represent large ranges of values.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ log of 0 is 1.","correct":"✓ log of 0 is undefined.","note":"The logarithm of 0 is undefined because there is no power to which a base can be raised to produce 0."},{"incorrect":"✗ The logarithm is the same as the exponentiation.","correct":"✓ The logarithm is the inverse of exponentiation.","note":"Logarithm and exponentiation are inverse operations."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["logarithmic (adjective: 対数の)","antilogarithm (noun: 逆対数)"],"related_terms":["exponentiation (noun: 指数関数)","exponential (adjective: 指数関数の)","base (noun: 底)"],"priority":"★★★"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C1","frequency_google_ngram":"Relatively low frequency, mainly used in technical contexts.","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"The term 'logarithm' refers to the exponent to which a base number must be raised to produce a given number. It's a concept primarily used in mathematics and related technical fields. Understanding logarithms requires familiarity with exponents and inverse functions. The most common types are the common logarithm (base 10) and the natural logarithm (base *e*). Logarithms are useful for simplifying complex calculations and representing very large or very small numbers on a more manageable scale.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The **logarithm** of 1000 to the base 10 is 3.","translation":"10を底とする1000の対数は3です。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"対数"},{"sentence":"We used a **logarithm** scale to represent the earthquake's magnitude.","translation":"地震の規模を表すために、対数スケールを使用しました。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"対数"},{"sentence":"The formula involves calculating the **logarithm** of the variable.","translation":"その公式は変数の対数を計算することを含みます。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"対数"},{"sentence":"Understanding **logarithms** is crucial for advanced mathematics.","translation":"対数を理解することは、高度な数学にとって非常に重要です。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"対数"}]}

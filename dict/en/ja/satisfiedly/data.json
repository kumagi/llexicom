It's not used as often as other words like \"happily\" or \"contentedly,\" so it's more common in formal writing or when you want to be very specific about showing someone's satisfaction. For example, instead of just saying \"He smiled,\" you could say \"He smiled satisfiedly\" to really emphasize that he was pleased with what happened."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The chef tasted the soup and nodded satisfiedly.","translation":"シェフはスープを味見し、満足そうに頷いた。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"満足そうに"},{"sentence":"She watched her children play satisfiedly.","translation":"彼女は子供たちが遊ぶのを満足そうに見ていた。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"満足そうに"},{"sentence":"He leaned back in his chair and sighed satisfiedly.","translation":"彼は椅子に寄りかかり、満足そうにため息をついた。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"満足そうに"}]}

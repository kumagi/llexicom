'Mention' comes from the Middle English 'mencioun', from Old French 'mention', from Latin 'mentio' (a calling to mind, a speaking of), from 'mentus', past participle of 'minisci' (to remember). The suffix '-less' means 'without'. Therefore, 'mentionless' means 'without mention'.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"ˈmɛnʃənləs","syllables":"men-tion-less"},"inflection":{"notes":"This is an adjective, so it can be used to modify nouns.

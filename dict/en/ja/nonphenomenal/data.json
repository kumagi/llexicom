It describes something that is not part of ordinary sensory experience or is not particularly remarkable. Understanding this word requires a grasp of the term \"phenomenal,\" which relates to phenomena or things that can be observed or experienced. \"Nonphenomenal\" simply negates this, indicating something beyond or outside of direct observation or experience.

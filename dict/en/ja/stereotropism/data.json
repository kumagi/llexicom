In stereotropism, the stimulus is a solid surface. This is particularly important for climbing plants, allowing them to find support and grow upwards. It can also be observed in roots, which may grow along the surface of rocks or other solid objects in the soil.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Stereotropism is a type of phototropism.","correct":"✓ Stereotropism is a type of tropism related to contact with a solid surface.","note":"Stereotropism is related to touch/contact, not light (phototropism)."},{"incorrect":"✗ Stereotropism only occurs in plants.","correct":"✓ Stereotropism is most commonly studied in plants, but can occur in other organisms.","note":"While most research focuses on plants, the principle can apply to other organisms that respond to solid surfaces."}],"priority":"★☆☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["stereotropic (adjective)"],"related_terms":["tropism","thigmotropism","phototropism","geotropism","hydrotropism"],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency - a technical term used primarily in biology.","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Stereotropism' is a specialized term in biology referring to the way organisms, especially plants, change their growth direction in response to a solid surface.

This is often used to simplify complex problems in engineering and physics. The idea is that near a specific point, a curved line (nonlinear function) can be approximated by a straight line (linear function). This makes the math easier to handle, but it's important to remember that the approximation is only valid close to that specific point. Think of it like zooming in really close on a curve – it starts to look like a straight line!"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The engineer used **linearization** to simplify the control system design.","translation":"エンジニアは、制御システムの設計を簡素化するために線形化を使用しました。","type":"general","meaning_category":"application"},{"sentence":"**Linearization** allows us to apply linear control techniques to a nonlinear system.","translation":"線形化により、非線形システムに線形制御技術を適用できます。","type":"general","meaning_category":"benefit"},{"sentence":"The accuracy of the **linearization** depends on the degree of nonlinearity and the range of operation.","translation":"線形化の精度は、非線形性の程度と動作範囲に依存します。","type":"technical","meaning_category":"limitation"}]}

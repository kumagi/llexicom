It is created using a stereomicroscope, which has two separate optical paths that provide slightly different perspectives of the same object. When these two images are captured and viewed together, they create a stereoscopic effect, allowing the viewer to perceive depth and spatial relationships within the sample. This technique is particularly useful in fields such as biology, materials science, and forensic science, where detailed surface topography and three-dimensional structure are important.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ stereophotomicroscope","correct":"✓ stereophotomicrograph","note":"Stereophotomicroscope is the instrument, stereophotomicrograph is the image produced."}],"priority":"★☆☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["stereomicroscope","photomicrograph","micrograph"],"phrasal_verbs":[],"priority":"★☆☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"非常に低頻度 (Very low frequency)","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"The word 'stereophotomicrograph' is a highly specialized term used in scientific and technical contexts. It refers to a photograph taken through a stereomicroscope to create a three-dimensional image of a microscopic object. Understanding this term requires knowledge of microscopy and photography.

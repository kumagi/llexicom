It refers to something that cannot be joined or connected. For example, in typography, certain character combinations may be \"unligable,\" meaning they cannot be combined into a single glyph or ligature. The word is formed by adding the prefix \"un-\" (meaning \"not\") to \"ligable,\" which itself relates to the ability to form a ligature (a single character formed by joining two or more letters). Understanding the term requires familiarity with technical concepts in the relevant field."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The software flagged the sequence as potentially unligable due to structural constraints.","translation":"ソフトウェアは、構造上の制約から、その配列を潜在的に結合不能であると判断しました。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"Not capable of being ligated"},{"sentence":"Some older fonts contain character pairs that are deliberately designed as unligable.","translation":"一部の古いフォントには、意図的に結合できないように設計された文字のペアが含まれています。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"Not capable of being ligated"}]}

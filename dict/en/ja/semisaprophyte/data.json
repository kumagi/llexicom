They can perform photosynthesis to produce their own food, but they also obtain nutrients from decaying organic material, often through a symbiotic relationship with fungi. This contrasts with holosaprophytes, which rely entirely on decaying organic matter, and autotrophs, which produce all their own food through photosynthesis.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Semisaprophytes are completely dependent on decaying matter.","correct":"✓ Semisaprophytes are partly dependent on decaying matter.","note":"Semisaprophytes are only partially dependent on decaying matter; they also photosynthesize."}],"priority":"★☆☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["semisaprophytic (adjective)"],"phrasal_verbs":[],"related_terms":["saprophyte","holosaprophyte","myco-heterotroph","autotroph","photosynthesis","fungus","symbiosis"],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"N/A (Specialized vocabulary)","frequency_google_ngram":"Very low frequency","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C2","text":"The term 'semisaprophyte' is a technical term used in botany and ecology to describe plants that obtain nutrients from both decaying organic matter and photosynthesis.

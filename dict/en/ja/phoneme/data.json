It's the smallest unit of sound that can change the meaning of a word. For example, the difference between the words 'bit' and 'pit' is a single phoneme: /b/ versus /p/. Phonemes are abstract units, and the actual sounds we produce (phones) can vary depending on the context. The study of phonemes is a key part of linguistics, specifically phonology, which deals with the sound systems of languages. Understanding phonemes is crucial for analyzing and understanding how speech works.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The English language has approximately 44 phonemes.","translation":"英語にはおよそ44の音素があります。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"音素"},{"sentence":"Linguists study the distribution and function of phonemes in different languages.","translation":"言語学者は異なる言語における音素の分布と機能を研究します。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"音素"},{"sentence":"Minimal pairs are used to identify phonemes in a language.","translation":"最小対は言語における音素を識別するために用いられます。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"音素"}]}

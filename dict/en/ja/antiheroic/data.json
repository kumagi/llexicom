More often, adverbs like 'more' and 'most' are used to express degrees of the adjective."},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"\"Antiheroic\" describes a character or action that lacks the traditional qualities of a hero, such as courage, nobility, and selflessness. Antiheroes are often flawed, morally ambiguous, and motivated by self-interest or other less-than-noble desires. They may even exhibit villainous traits, although they are not necessarily villains. The term is often used in literature, film, and other forms of storytelling to describe characters who are relatable and complex, but not necessarily admirable.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ He was antiheroic because he was scared.","correct":"✓ He was unheroic because he was scared. / ✓ His actions were antiheroic because he prioritized his own safety over others'.","note":"While fear might make someone unheroic (lacking courage), antiheroism often involves more complex moral failings or a rejection of traditional heroic ideals. The corrected sentences clarify the distinction: one focuses on a lack of courage, while the other highlights prioritizing self-interest."},{"incorrect":"✗ The villain was antiheroic.","correct":"✓ The villain had antiheroic qualities.","note":"While an antihero may have some villainous traits, they are not necessarily villains.

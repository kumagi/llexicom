It is often preferred over 'childless' because it emphasizes choice rather than a perceived lack. It can also refer to spaces or services that are designed to be free of children. The term is often associated with a desire for greater personal freedom, career focus, or financial independence.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ They are childless, but they want to be child-free.","correct":"✓ They are childless, but they want to be parents. / ✓ They are child-free by choice.","note":"'Childless' means without children, regardless of choice. 'Child-free' means choosing not to have children. The sentence implies a contradiction if someone is childless but wants to be child-free, as being child-free implies a choice.

Its usage is infrequent in modern English, and it may sound dated or regional. In some Northern dialects of British English, \"tike\" can also refer to a dog, but this usage is even less common. Due to its limited and specific contexts, learners should be aware of its potential to sound old-fashioned or unfamiliar to many speakers. It's best to use more common terms like \"child,\" \"kid,\" or \"tot\" in general conversation.","note":"This word is not commonly used and may be unfamiliar to many English speakers."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The little **tike** was covered in mud after playing in the garden.","translation":"その小さな子供は庭で遊んだ後、泥だらけだった。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"子供"},{"sentence":"(Northern UK dialect) 'Come here, **tike**!' he called to his dog.","translation":"（イギリス北部方言）「こっちに来い、犬！」彼は犬に呼びかけた。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"犬"}]}

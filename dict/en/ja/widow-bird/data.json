They are native to Africa, south of the Sahara. The males of many widow-bird species are known for their extraordinarily long tail feathers, which they display during the breeding season to attract females. The length of the tail feathers can be several times the body length of the bird. These long tails are thought to be a result of sexual selection, where females prefer males with longer tails, leading to the evolution of this trait.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The widow bird is a type of fish.","correct":"✓ The widow-bird is a type of bird.","note":"Widow-birds are birds, not fish."},{"incorrect":"✗ Only female widow-birds have long tails.","correct":"✓ Only male widow-birds have long tails.","note":"The long tail feathers are a characteristic of male widow-birds during the breeding season."}],"priority":"★☆☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":[],"phrasal_verbs":[],"related_species":["long-tailed widow-bird (Euplectes progne)","red-collared widow-bird (Euplectes ardens)","white-winged widow-bird (Euplectes albonotatus)"],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"Unknown","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"The term \"widow-bird\" refers to a specific group of birds within the weaver family, known for the males' elongated tail feathers during breeding season.

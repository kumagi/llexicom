It describes a strain of animals (typically mice or rats) that has been bred to be genetically identical to another strain, except for a small region of the genome. This is achieved through repeated backcrossing, where offspring are repeatedly mated with individuals from the background strain. Congenic strains are essential tools for studying the effects of individual genes or genetic regions on various traits and diseases. They allow researchers to isolate and examine the impact of specific genetic differences while minimizing the influence of other genetic variations.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The animals were completely identical.

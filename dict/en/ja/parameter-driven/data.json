Imagine a video game where you can change the difficulty level, the number of lives, or the sound volume. These settings are parameters, and the game is parameter-driven because changing them directly affects how the game plays. This term is often used in technical fields like software development and engineering to describe systems that are highly customizable without needing to change the core code.","priority":"★★★"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The new rendering engine is entirely parameter-driven, which allows for fine-grained control over the visual output.","translation":"新しいレンダリングエンジンは完全にパラメータ駆動型であり、視覚的な出力に対するきめ細かい制御が可能です。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"パラメータによって制御される"},{"sentence":"A parameter-driven approach to data analysis enables researchers to explore a wide range of scenarios.","translation":"データ分析へのパラメータ駆動型アプローチにより、研究者は幅広いシナリオを調査できます。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"パラメータによって制御される"},{"sentence":"The simulation software uses a parameter-driven model to predict the spread of infectious diseases.","translation":"シミュレーションソフトウェアは、パラメータ駆動型モデルを使用して、感染症の蔓延を予測します。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"パラメータによって制御される"}]}

It provides an extra layer of protection against rain, wind, and sun. It also helps to reduce condensation inside the tent by creating a barrier between the warm, moist air inside the tent and the cooler air outside. The tent-fly is typically attached to the main tent body using clips, buckles, or Velcro straps. Some tent designs integrate the tent-fly as a permanent part of the structure, while others allow it to be removed or rolled back for ventilation on clear nights.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The tent fly kept us warm.","correct":"✓ The tent-fly kept us dry.","note":"A tent-fly primarily protects from rain and wind, not necessarily from cold.

It's often used in philosophical, scientific, or technical contexts where precise distinctions are important. The word itself is formed from the negative prefix \"in-\" and \"discernibility,\" which means the ability to perceive or recognize differences. Therefore, \"indiscernibility\" is the opposite of being able to tell things apart. Understanding this word requires a good grasp of abstract concepts and formal vocabulary."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The principle of the indiscernibility of identicals states that if two entities have all the same properties, then they are the same entity.","translation":"同一者識別不能原理は、もし二つの存在が全く同じ性質を持つなら、それらは同一の存在であると述べる。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"識別不能性"},{"sentence":"The indiscernibility of the artist's brushstrokes contributed to the painting's ethereal quality.","translation":"画家の筆致の識別不能性が、絵画の幽玄な質に貢献した。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"判別不能性"},{"sentence":"Due to the advanced camouflage, there was complete indiscernibility between the soldier and the surrounding environment.","translation":"高度な迷彩のおかげで、兵士と周囲の環境との間には完全な識別不能性があった。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"区別できないこと"}]}

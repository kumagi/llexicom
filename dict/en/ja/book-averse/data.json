It's a more specific and somewhat formal way of saying someone 'doesn't like to read.' The word is formed by combining 'book' and 'averse,' which means having a strong dislike or opposition to something. Because it's not a common word, it's more likely to be encountered in written texts or discussions about reading habits, education, or literacy. Understanding the meaning of 'averse' is helpful in deciphering the meaning of 'book-averse.'"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The school librarian worked hard to find books that would appeal to book-averse teenagers.","translation":"学校の司書は、本嫌いのティーンエイジャーにアピールする本を見つけるために懸命に努力しました。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"本嫌いの"},{"sentence":"Many adults who are now avid readers were once book-averse children.","translation":"現在熱心な読者である多くの大人は、かつては本嫌いな子供でした。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"本嫌いの"},{"sentence":"The program aims to help book-averse students discover the joy of reading.","translation":"このプログラムは、本嫌いの生徒たちが読書の楽しさを発見するのを支援することを目的としています。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"本嫌いの"}]}

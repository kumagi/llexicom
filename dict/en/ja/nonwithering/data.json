'Withering' comes from the Middle English 'witheren', meaning 'to dry up, shrivel, or lose freshness', which is derived from Old English 'witherian'. Thus, 'nonwithering' literally means 'not undergoing the process of drying up or losing freshness'.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/ˌnɒnˈwɪðərɪŋ/","syllables":"non-with-er-ing"},"inflection":{"adjective_forms":{"comparative":"more nonwithering","superlative":"most nonwithering"}},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Nonwithering' is typically used to describe something that maintains its freshness, beauty, or vigor over time, resisting the natural process of decay or decline.

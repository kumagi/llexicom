It's a critical aspect of memory management in programming, particularly in languages where memory is managed manually (e.g., C, C++). Failure to properly deallocate memory can lead to memory leaks, where memory is allocated but never released, eventually causing the program to crash or become unstable. In languages with automatic garbage collection (e.g., Java, Python), the garbage collector automatically handles deallocations, reducing the risk of memory leaks but potentially introducing performance overhead.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The deallocation was made by the compiler.","correct":"✓ The deallocation was handled by the garbage collector.","note":"In languages with garbage collection, deallocation is not directly controlled by the programmer or compiler, but by the garbage collector.

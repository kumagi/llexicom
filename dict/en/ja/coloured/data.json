As an adjective, it simply means 'having color'. However, it's crucial to be aware that 'coloured' was historically used as a racial term, particularly in South Africa under apartheid, and in the United States during segregation. This usage is now considered offensive and outdated. When referring to people, it is generally more appropriate and respectful to use terms like 'people of color' or to specify the person's ethnicity or race.

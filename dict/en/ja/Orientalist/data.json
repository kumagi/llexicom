Orientalism, in this context, refers to a Western perspective that often exoticizes, romanticizes, or misrepresents Eastern cultures.

However, it's important to know that this word can be controversial. This is because 'Orientalism' (the field of study) has been criticized for sometimes presenting a biased or stereotypical view of Eastern cultures. So, while the word itself isn't always negative, it's good to be aware of its potential negative connotations and use it carefully. It is often better to use more specific terms like 'scholar of Japanese studies' or 'Middle Eastern historian' to avoid any misunderstanding.","priority":"★★★"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"Many **orientalists** have contributed to our understanding of Asian history.","translation":"多くの東洋学者がアジアの歴史の理解に貢献してきた。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"東洋学者"},{"sentence":"The museum's collection includes many examples of **orientalist** art.","translation":"その美術館のコレクションには、多くの東洋学的な芸術作品が含まれている。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"東洋学の"},{"sentence":"Edward Said's book 'Orientalism' is a critical analysis of **orientalist** perspectives.","translation":"エドワード・サイードの著書『オリエンタリズム』は、東洋学的な視点を批判的に分析したものである。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"東洋学の"}]}

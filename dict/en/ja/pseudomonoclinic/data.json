It describes crystals that appear to have the symmetry of the monoclinic crystal system but, upon closer examination, are found to belong to a different crystal system due to subtle deviations in their structure or properties. This term is primarily encountered in scientific literature related to mineralogy and materials science."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The XRD analysis revealed that the sample was not truly monoclinic but exhibited a pseudomonoclinic structure.","translation":"XRD分析により、サンプルは真の単斜晶系ではなく、擬単斜晶系構造を示すことが明らかになった。","type":"scientific context","meaning_category":"crystallography"}]}

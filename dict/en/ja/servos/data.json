The term 'servomechanism' originates from the Latin word 'servus,' meaning 'slave' or 'servant,' as it describes a mechanism that 'serves' to control another device or system.","priority":"★★★"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"ˈsɜːrvoʊz","syllables":"ser-vos"},"inflection":{"noun_plural":"servos"},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Servos' refers to multiple servomechanisms or servomotors. A servomechanism is a feedback control system that uses error-sensing to correct the performance of a mechanism. A servomotor is a type of motor that incorporates a servomechanism to provide precise control over its position, speed, and acceleration. Servos are commonly used in robotics, radio-controlled models, and industrial automation.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The servo is broken, so all servos are not working.","correct":"✓ One servo is broken, so the system isn't working.","note":"If only one servo is broken, it doesn't necessarily mean all servos are not working.

It describes a situation where a program allocates memory for its use but fails to release that memory back to the system when it's no longer needed. This results in a gradual accumulation of unused memory, eventually leading to performance degradation or even system crashes. It is a serious bug that developers must address.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The memory is leaking.","correct":"✓ The program is memory-leaking.","note":"It's more accurate to say the program *is memory-leaking* or *has a memory leak*, rather than saying *the memory is leaking*.

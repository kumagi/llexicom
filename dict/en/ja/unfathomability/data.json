Thus, \"fathomable\" meant 'capable of being measured or understood,' and adding the prefix \"un-\" reverses the meaning to 'incapable of being measured or understood.' The suffix \"-ability\" turns the adjective into a noun, denoting the quality or state of being unfathomable.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/ˌʌnfæðəməˈbɪləti/","syllables":"un-fath-om-a-bil-i-ty (6 syllables)"},"inflection":{"noun_plural":"unfathomabilities (rarely used)"},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"\"Unfathomability\" refers to something that is so deep, complex, or mysterious that it cannot be fully understood or measured.

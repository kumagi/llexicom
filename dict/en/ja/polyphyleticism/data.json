It describes a situation where a group of organisms that are classified together do not share a single common ancestor. Instead, they have evolved from different ancestral lines. Understanding this term requires a solid background in evolutionary biology and the principles of phylogenetic classification. It is typically encountered in advanced scientific literature and discussions.

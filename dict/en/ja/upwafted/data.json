It is often used in descriptive writing, especially when talking about scents, smoke, or other light objects. Because it is not a common word, it is best to use it in contexts where the meaning is clear from the surrounding words. It is more often found in literature or specialized writing than in everyday conversation."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The aroma of freshly baked bread upwafted from the bakery.","translation":"焼きたてのパンの香りがパン屋から立ち上ってきた。","type":"descriptive","meaning_category":"香り"},{"sentence":"Dust motes upwafted in the sunlit room.","translation":"塵が日の当たる部屋で舞い上がった。","type":"descriptive","meaning_category":"空気中の粒子"},{"sentence":"The kite upwafted higher and higher into the sky.","translation":"凧は空高く舞い上がった。","type":"descriptive","meaning_category":"上昇"}]}

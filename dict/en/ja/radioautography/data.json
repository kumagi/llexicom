It involves placing the sample in close contact with a photographic emulsion, which is sensitive to radiation. The emitted radiation exposes the emulsion, creating an image that shows the location of the radioactive material. This technique is widely used in biology, medicine, and materials science to study various processes and structures.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ I used radioautography to see the cells directly.","correct":"✓ I used radioautography to visualize the distribution of radioactive substances in the cells.","note":"Radioautography doesn't allow direct observation of cells but rather visualizes the location of radioactive materials within them."}],"priority":"★☆☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["autoradiogram (名詞: 自己放射線写真)","radiolabel (動詞: 放射性同位体で標識する；名詞: 放射性標識)"],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"Radioautography is a specialized technique used in scientific research to visualize the distribution of radioactive materials within a sample.

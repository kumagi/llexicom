The reaction typically involves the addition of ozone across the double bond of the alkene, resulting in a cyclic peroxide structure. Ozonides are often unstable and can be explosive, especially in concentrated form. They are important intermediates in ozonolysis reactions, which are used in organic chemistry for cleaving carbon-carbon double bonds.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Ozonide is a element.","correct":"✓ Ozonide is a compound.","note":"Ozonide is a compound, not an element."},{"incorrect":"✗ Ozonides are very stable.","correct":"✓ Ozonides are often unstable.","note":"Ozonides are generally unstable and can be explosive."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["ozone","ozonolysis"],"phrasal_verbs":[]},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"非常に低頻度 (Very low frequency) - 化学の専門用語。","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"Ozonides are a specialized chemical term referring to cyclic peroxides produced when ozone reacts with unsaturated organic compounds.

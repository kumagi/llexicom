It can be a conscious or unconscious behavior, often stemming from a lack of confidence or a desire to appear humble. While a degree of modesty can be seen as a positive trait, excessive self-detraction can be detrimental to one's self-esteem and relationships. It's important to distinguish self-detraction from genuine humility, as the former often involves a negative self-perception, while the latter is simply an accurate assessment of one's strengths and weaknesses."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"Despite her numerous awards, she was prone to self-detraction.","translation":"数々の賞を受賞しているにもかかわらず、彼女は自己卑下しがちだった。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"自己卑下"},{"sentence":"His self-detraction was so ingrained that he couldn't accept compliments.","translation":"彼の自己卑下は深く根付いており、褒め言葉を受け入れることができなかった。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"自己卑下"},{"sentence":"The therapist helped her overcome her habit of self-detraction.","translation":"セラピストは彼女が自己卑下の癖を克服するのを助けた。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"自己卑下"}]}

It describes something (like an algorithm or a piece of software) that can work with different kinds of data structures without needing to be changed. This is useful because it makes the code more flexible and reusable. If something is data-structure-agnostic, it doesn't care how the data is organized; it can still process it correctly. This term is typically used in advanced technical discussions.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The framework provides data-structure-agnostic components for building scalable applications.","translation":"このフレームワークは、スケーラブルなアプリケーションを構築するためのデータ構造に依存しないコンポーネントを提供します。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"データ構造に依存しない"},{"sentence":"A data-structure-agnostic approach simplifies the integration of various data sources.","translation":"データ構造に依存しないアプローチは、さまざまなデータソースの統合を簡素化します。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"データ構造に依存しない"},{"sentence":"The goal is to create a data-structure-agnostic interface for accessing the database.","translation":"目標は、データベースにアクセスするためのデータ構造に依存しないインターフェースを作成することです。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"データ構造に依存しない"}]}

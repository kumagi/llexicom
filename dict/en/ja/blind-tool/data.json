It refers to a tool designed for a single, specific operation, such as punching a hole, bending a flange, or cutting a shape. Unlike progressive dies or multi-stage tools that perform multiple operations in sequence, a blind-tool completes only one task per cycle. This simplicity makes them efficient for high-volume production of simple parts, but less versatile for complex geometries or multi-step processes.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The blind-tool can perform several operations at once.","correct":"✓ The blind-tool performs only one operation at a time.","note":"Blind-tools are defined by their single-operation nature."},{"incorrect":"✗ Use a progressive die instead of a blind-tool for simple tasks.","correct":"✓ Use a blind-tool instead of a progressive die for simple, high-volume tasks.","note":"Blind-tools are generally more cost-effective for simple, high-volume production."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":[],"phrasal_verbs":[],"related_terms":["stamping","forming","punching","die","tooling","progressive die","single-stage","manufacturing"],"priority":"★★★"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"N/A (Technical vocabulary)","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency (Specialized term)","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"The term 'blind-tool' is a technical term used in manufacturing, specifically in the context of metalworking and stamping processes.

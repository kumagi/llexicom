It is often contrasted with 'uncountably', which describes sets that are 'too large' to be listed in this way.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The stars in the sky are enumerably many.","correct":"✓ The stars visible to the naked eye are enumerably many.","note":"While the number of stars visible to the naked eye is finite and thus enumerable, the total number of stars in the sky is considered uncountably infinite in some contexts.

It encompasses various types of speech difficulties, including stuttering (also known as stammering), hesitations, repetitions of sounds, syllables, or words, prolongations of sounds, and interjections (e.g., 'um,' 'uh').

It's a broad term that includes things like stuttering, hesitations, repetitions of sounds or words, and prolongations of sounds. Instead of just saying someone 'stutters,' professionals might use 'dysfluency' to describe the general problem of not speaking smoothly. This word is more common in academic papers, clinical reports, and discussions among specialists rather than in everyday conversation. If you're reading something about speech problems, you might come across 'dysfluency' as a way to talk about the different ways someone's speech isn't flowing smoothly."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The therapist assessed the child's speech for signs of **dysfluency**.","translation":"セラピストは、その子供の言語に非流暢性の兆候がないか評価した。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"発話困難"},{"sentence":"Research suggests that early intervention can improve **dysfluency** in young children.","translation":"研究は、早期介入が幼い子供の非流暢性を改善できることを示唆している。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"発話困難"},{"sentence":"His **dysfluency** was characterized by frequent repetitions of syllables.","translation":"彼の非流暢性は、音節の頻繁な繰り返しによって特徴づけられた。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"発話困難"},{"sentence":"She is working with a speech-language pathologist to manage her **dysfluency**.","translation":"彼女は言語聴覚士と協力して、自身の非流暢性を管理している。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"発話困難"}]}

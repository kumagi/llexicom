It is best understood in contrast to its opposite, 'musing', which describes a state of thoughtful contemplation. 'Unmusing' therefore indicates a lack of such contemplation or thoughtfulness. It is more often used in literary or descriptive writing to convey a character's lack of introspection or engagement with deeper thoughts. The word is more conceptual than practical, and its usage requires a nuanced understanding of its root word, 'musing'."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The politician gave an unmusing response to the complex question.","translation":"政治家は複雑な質問に対して、熟考しない返答をした。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"Lacking thoughtfulness"},{"sentence":"After hours of pondering, she decided to unmuse herself and get some sleep.","translation":"何時間も考えた後、彼女は思考を切り離して眠ることにした。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"Ceasing to muse"},{"sentence":"His unmusing gaze suggested a mind elsewhere occupied.","translation":"彼のぼんやりとした視線は、心が別の場所にあることを示唆していた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"Lacking contemplation"}]}

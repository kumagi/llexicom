It is used when the pronoun is the object of a verb or a preposition. In modern English, 'whoever' is often used in place of 'whomever', especially in informal contexts. However, using 'whomever' is still considered more grammatically correct in formal writing. To determine whether to use 'whoever' or 'whomever', try replacing the clause with 'him' or 'he'. If 'him' fits, use 'whomever'; if 'he' fits, use 'whoever'. For example, in the sentence 'Give it to whomever you please,' 'you please him' makes sense, so 'whomever' is correct.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Give it to whoever you please.","correct":"✓ Give it to whomever you please.","note":"Incorrect use of 'whoever' when the pronoun is the object of the preposition 'to'."},{"incorrect":"✗ I will support whomever is chosen.","correct":"✓ I will support whoever is chosen.","note":"Incorrect use of 'whomever' when the pronoun is the subject of the verb 'is'."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["whoever","whom","ever"],"idioms_phrases":[],"priority":"★★★"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency - Primarily used in formal writing.","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Whomever' is a formal pronoun that means 'any person whom'. It's used when the pronoun is the object of a verb or preposition. In simpler terms, it's like saying 'him' or 'her' instead of 'he' or 'she'. For example, 'Give the prize to whomever you think deserves it' means 'Give the prize to the person whom you think deserves it'. It's not used very often in everyday conversation, but you might see it in formal writing or legal documents. In many cases, 'whoever' can be used instead, especially in informal situations."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The scholarship will be awarded to **whomever** the committee deems most deserving.","translation":"奨学金は委員会が最もふさわしいと判断した人に授与されます。","type":"pronoun","meaning_category":"誰を～しようとも"},{"sentence":"I will vote for **whomever** my conscience dictates.","translation":"私は良心が命じる人に投票します。","type":"pronoun","meaning_category":"誰を～しようとも"},{"sentence":"They will hire **whomever** has the best qualifications.","translation":"彼らは最も優れた資格を持つ人を採用するでしょう。","type":"pronoun","meaning_category":"誰を～しようとも"},{"sentence":"The company will sue **whomever** is responsible for the damage.","translation":"会社は損害の責任者である誰であろうと訴えます。","type":"pronoun","meaning_category":"誰を～しようとも"}]}

It's most commonly known for its use as a preservative – it prevents decay of biological tissues. Because of this property, formalin is widely used in laboratories (like dissecting specimens), museums (preserving anatomical samples), and mortuaries (embalming bodies).  It also has some limited uses as a disinfectant. However, it's important to remember that formalin is toxic and carcinogenic, so it must be handled with extreme caution and proper safety measures."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The biology student used **formalin** to preserve the frog specimen for study.","translation":"生物学の学生は、研究のためにカエルの標本をホルマリンで保存した。","type":"scientific context","meaning_category":"preservation"},{"sentence":"The mortician used **formalin** as part of the embalming process.","translation":"葬儀屋は、遺体防腐処理の一部としてホルマリンを使用した。","type":"medical context","meaning_category":"embalming"},{"sentence":"Due to its toxicity, **formalin** is handled with extreme care in the laboratory.","translation":"毒性があるため、ホルマリンは実験室では細心の注意を払って取り扱われます。","type":"safety context","meaning_category":"toxicity"},{"sentence":"Museums often use **formalin** to preserve delicate historical specimens.","translation":"博物館では、繊細な歴史的標本を保存するためにホルマリンがよく使用されます。","type":"museum context","meaning_category":"preservation"},{"sentence":"Exposure to high levels of **formalin** can be hazardous to your health.","translation":"高濃度のホルマリンにさらされると、健康に有害です。","type":"health context","meaning_category":"toxicity"}]}

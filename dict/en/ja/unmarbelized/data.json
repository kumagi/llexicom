Thus, 'unmarbelized' literally means 'not treated to resemble marble'.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/ʌnˈmɑːrbəlaɪzd/","syllables":"un-mar-bel-ized"},"inflection":{"notes":"Adjectives do not typically inflect except for comparative and superlative forms, which are less common for this word.

It can also be used more broadly to describe other materials or surfaces that do not have a marble-like pattern or texture.

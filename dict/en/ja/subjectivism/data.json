It asserts that there is no objective truth independent of individual understanding. This contrasts with objectivism, which posits the existence of an external reality that can be known independently of individual perspectives. Subjectivism can manifest in various forms, including ethical subjectivism (where moral judgments are seen as expressions of personal feelings) and epistemological subjectivism (where knowledge is viewed as fundamentally subjective).

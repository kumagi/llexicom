It's often used when the movement is somewhat aimless or lacks enthusiasm. For example, 'The children came trooping into the kitchen' means the children entered the kitchen together, perhaps noisily or without much order. It can also refer to a formal march, like 'Trooping the Colour.' This word is more common in descriptive writing and less frequent in everyday conversation."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The students were **trooping** into the lecture hall before class.","translation":"授業前に学生たちがぞろぞろと講堂に入って行った。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"walking in a group"},{"sentence":"We watched the ceremonial **trooping** of the guards.","translation":"私たちは衛兵たちの儀式的な行進を見守った。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"marching"},{"sentence":"They spent the afternoon **trooping** around the shops.","translation":"彼らは午後を店をぞろぞろ歩き回って過ごした。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"walking in a group"},{"sentence":"After the game, the fans came **trooping** out of the stadium.","translation":"試合後、ファンたちがぞろぞろとスタジアムから出てきた。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"walking in a group"}]}

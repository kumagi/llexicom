Imagine building with LEGOs: a constituent is like a pre-assembled LEGO structure that you can move around as one piece, while a nonconstituent is just a random collection of LEGO bricks that aren't connected in any meaningful way. Identifying constituents and nonconstituents helps linguists understand how sentences are structured and how meaning is created.

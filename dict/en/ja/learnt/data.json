It means you knew something in the past because you studied it or were taught it. It's more common in British English. In American English, people usually say 'learned' instead. For example, you can say 'I learnt a new word today' or 'I have learnt how to cook pasta'. Remember that 'learned' can also be an adjective meaning 'very smart', but 'learnt' cannot be used as an adjective."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"She **learnt** to speak French fluently.","translation":"彼女はフランス語を流暢に話せるようになった。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"学んだ (過去形)"},{"sentence":"He had **learnt** his lesson and never cheated again.","translation":"彼は教訓を学び、二度と不正行為をしなかった。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"学んだ (過去分詞)"},{"sentence":"I **learnt** about the history of Japan in school.","translation":"私は学校で日本の歴史について学んだ。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"学んだ (過去形)"},{"sentence":"They have **learnt** a lot from their mistakes.","translation":"彼らは自分たちの間違いから多くのことを学んだ。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"学んだ (過去分詞)"}]}

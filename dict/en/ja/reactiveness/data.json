It can be used in a variety of contexts, including chemistry, engineering, and even business. In chemistry, it describes how readily a substance undergoes a chemical reaction.

It's often used in science and engineering to talk about how chemicals or systems behave. For example, you might say a certain metal has high 'reactiveness' to acid, meaning it reacts strongly. It's a more formal and technical term than 'responsiveness'.

The process involves immersing the metal part in a bath containing a water-based solution of paint or other coating material. An electrical current is then passed through the bath, causing the coating material to deposit onto the metal surface.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ electrocataphores","correct":"✓ electrocataphoresis","note":"The correct term is electrocataphoresis, not electrocataphores."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["electrophoresis","cataphoresis","electrodeposition"],"phrasal_verbs":[],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low Frequency","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"Electrocataphoresis is a technical term used in the field of surface coating and material science. It refers to a specific method of electrophoretic deposition where charged particles in a liquid suspension are attracted to a conductive surface under the influence of an electric field, forming a coating. The term is primarily encountered in industrial and academic contexts related to painting, corrosion protection, and surface treatment. Understanding this term requires familiarity with basic concepts of electrochemistry and material processing."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The use of electrocataphoresis ensures a uniform and corrosion-resistant coating on the metal components.","translation":"電気泳動塗装の使用は、金属部品に均一で耐腐食性のコーティングを保証します。","type":"general","meaning_category":"coating process"},{"sentence":"In cathodic electrocataphoresis, the positively charged particles are attracted to the negatively charged cathode.","translation":"陰極電気泳動塗装では、正に帯電した粒子が負に帯電した陰極に引き寄せられます。","type":"technical","meaning_category":"cathodic process"}]}

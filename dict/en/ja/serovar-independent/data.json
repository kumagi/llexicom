It describes something (e.g., a vaccine, an assay, an immune response) that is effective or applicable regardless of the specific serovar (serotype) of a pathogen. This is particularly important when dealing with pathogens that have many different serovars, as it allows for broader protection or detection without needing to target each serovar individually.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ serovar independent","correct":"✓ serovar-independent","note":"The term is typically hyphenated when used as an adjective.

It describes something that is not specific to a particular serovar (or serotype) of a microorganism. Serovars are variations within a species of bacteria or virus, classified based on their surface antigens. A serovar-independent approach, such as a vaccine, would provide protection against multiple serovars, rather than just one. This term is typically encountered in scientific literature or discussions related to infectious diseases and vaccine development."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The goal is to develop a serovar-independent vaccine against Salmonella.","translation":"目標は、サルモネラ菌に対する血清型非依存性ワクチンを開発することである。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"immunology"},{"sentence":"A serovar-independent diagnostic test would be valuable for rapid identification of the pathogen.","translation":"血清型非依存性の診断検査は、病原体の迅速な同定に役立つだろう。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"diagnostics"}]}

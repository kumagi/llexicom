It describes the process where atoms or molecules gain or lose electrons, resulting in the formation of ions. This term is commonly used in the context of radiation, such as 'ionising radiation', which carries enough energy to remove electrons from atoms, potentially causing damage to living tissues. Understanding this term requires some background knowledge in science.

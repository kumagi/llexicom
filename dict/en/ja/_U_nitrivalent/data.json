The 'tri-' in 'trivalent' refers to the historical association of valence with the number of hydrogen atoms an element could combine with or replace, with hydrogen being considered univalent.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/ˌjuːnɪˈtraɪveɪlənt/","syllables":"U-ni-tri-va-lent"},"inflection":{"notes":"Adjectives do not typically inflect in English, though they can be modified by adverbs (e.g., 'very unitrivalent')."},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"The term 'unitrivalent' is primarily used in chemistry to describe elements or ions that have a valence of one. Valence refers to the number of chemical bonds an atom can form. Unitrivalent elements, such as alkali metals (e.g., sodium, potassium), readily lose one electron to form a positive ion with a charge of +1. This property is crucial in understanding the formation of ionic compounds.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The compound is unitrivalent, so it has three valence electrons.","correct":"✓ The compound is unitrivalent, so it has one valence electron.","note":"Unitrivalent means having a valence of one, not three."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["univalence (noun): the state of being univalent"],"related_terms":["valence","monovalent","ion","chemical bond","alkali metal"]},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Unitrivalent' is a technical term used in chemistry.

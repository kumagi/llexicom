This term is often used in technical contexts, such as data analysis or statistics, to indicate that data has been processed in a way that removes too much of its natural variation, potentially leading to inaccurate or misleading results. It implies that the process of normalization, which is usually intended to improve data quality, has been taken too far, resulting in a loss of valuable information or detail.

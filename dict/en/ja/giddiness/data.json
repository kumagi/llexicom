However, it can also describe a state of lighthearted silliness or frivolous behavior. The context usually makes it clear which meaning is intended. When referring to the medical condition, it is often used interchangeably with 'dizziness' or 'vertigo,' although 'vertigo' specifically implies a spinning sensation. When referring to behavior, it suggests a lack of seriousness or a tendency to act foolishly, often due to excitement or joy.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ He felt a giddiness in his stomach.","correct":"✓ He felt a fluttering/butterflies in his stomach.","note":"'Giddiness' is not typically used to describe sensations in the stomach.

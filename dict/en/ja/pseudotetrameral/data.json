It describes something that looks like a tetramer (a structure with four parts) but isn't a true tetramer. Understanding this word requires knowledge of basic chemistry and biology concepts such as monomers, dimers, and polymers. The prefix 'pseudo-' indicates that the structure only resembles a tetramer without actually being one. Therefore, it is a high-level vocabulary word primarily found in scientific papers and textbooks."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The crystal structure revealed a pseudotetrameral arrangement of the protein subunits.","translation":"結晶構造は、タンパク質サブユニットの擬似テトラマー配置を明らかにした。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"Structure"},{"sentence":"Biochemical assays confirmed the pseudotetrameral nature of the enzyme complex.","translation":"生化学的アッセイは、酵素複合体の擬似テトラマー的な性質を確認した。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"Properties"}]}

It refers to a group of atoms which, when attached to a chromophore (a color-bearing molecule), alters both the wavelength and intensity of absorption. It does not impart color on its own. Understanding requires some background in organic chemistry and color theory."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The presence of the auxochrome deepened the color of the dye.","translation":"助色団の存在が染料の色を濃くした。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"助色団"},{"sentence":"Different auxochromes can lead to variations in the shade of a dye.","translation":"異なる助色団は染料の色合いのバリエーションにつながる可能性がある。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"助色団"}]}

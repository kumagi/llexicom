It suggests a process of reviewing and restructuring something, whether it's a plan, a design, or a written piece. The action implies a previous outline existed, and that it is now being reconsidered or improved.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ I reoutlined the plan yesterday, but I will reoutline it again tomorrow.","correct":"✓ I reoutlined the plan yesterday, and I might revise it further tomorrow.","note":"Using 'reoutline again' is redundant because the prefix 're-' already indicates repetition.

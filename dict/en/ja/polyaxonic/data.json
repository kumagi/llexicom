This is in contrast to the more common types of neurons, such as unipolar, bipolar, and multipolar neurons, which have only one axon. Polyaxonic neurons are relatively rare, and their functional significance is still being investigated.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{},"related_words":{"derivatives":["axon","axonic","multipolar neuron"],"related_terms":["neuron","neurobiology","histology"]},"level_frequency":{},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C2","text":"'Polyaxonic' is a specialized term used in neurobiology to describe neurons with multiple axons.

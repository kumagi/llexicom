'Euphoniously' comes from 'euphonious', which is derived from the Greek word 'euphōnos' meaning 'sweet-voiced' or 'melodious' (eu- = 'good, well' + phōnē = 'sound, voice'). Therefore, 'uneuphoniously' literally means 'not in a good-sounding manner'.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/ˌjuːˌjuːfəˈnoʊniəsli/","syllables":"u-eu-pho-ni-ous-ly"},"inflection":{"notes":"Adverbs do not inflect."},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Uneuphoniously' describes the manner in which something sounds unpleasant or discordant.

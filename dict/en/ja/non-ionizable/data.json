Ions are atoms or molecules that have an electrical charge due to gaining or losing electrons. If a substance is \"non-ionizable,\" it means it will not form these charged particles under normal conditions. This property can affect how the substance interacts with other materials and its behavior in various environments. It is a more advanced concept and not commonly used in everyday language."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"Glucose is a non-ionizable sugar.","translation":"グルコースはイオン化しない糖である。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"化学"},{"sentence":"The polymer's non-ionizable backbone contributes to its stability.","translation":"そのポリマーの非イオン化性の骨格は、その安定性に寄与する。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"材料科学"}]}

It describes something that has or involves multiple protons. Protons are positively charged particles found in the nucleus of an atom. Therefore, \"multi-protonic\" is used to describe molecules or reactions that involve the transfer or interaction of more than one proton. This term is most likely to be encountered in scientific literature related to acids, bases, and chemical reactions.","priority":"★★★"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The behavior of the multi-protonic system was studied using computational methods.","translation":"多プロトン系の挙動は、計算手法を用いて研究された。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"プロトンに関する"},{"sentence":"This multi-protonic compound is essential for the catalytic process.","translation":"この多プロトン化合物は、触媒プロセスに不可欠である。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"プロトンに関する"}]}

The blastopore, the first opening to form during gastrulation, becomes the anus in deuterostomes, while the mouth forms later. This is in contrast to protostomes, where the blastopore becomes the mouth. Deuterostomes also typically exhibit radial cleavage and enterocoely (formation of the coelom from pouches pinched off of the digestive tract). The group includes echinoderms (such as starfish and sea urchins), chordates (including vertebrates like humans), and hemichordates (acorn worms).","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Deuterostomes are animals where the mouth forms first.","correct":"✓ Deuterostomes are animals where the anus forms first.","note":"Deuterostomes are characterized by the anus forming from the blastopore, not the mouth."}],"priority":"★☆☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["deuterostomic (adjective)"],"related_terms":["protostome","blastopore","gastrulation","echinoderm","chordate","hemichordate"]},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"The term 'deuterostome' is a technical term used in zoology and developmental biology.

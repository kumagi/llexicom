For the 'murmuring stream' sense, it's likely imitative, reflecting the sound of flowing water.\n2.  For the 'knitting stitch' sense, it comes from Middle English 'purlen' meaning 'to embroider with gold or silver thread,' possibly from Old French 'pourfiler' (to fringe), from 'fil' (thread), from Latin 'filum.' The connection between the two meanings is not entirely clear, but it might relate to the twisting or turning motion involved in both flowing water and creating the stitch.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/ˈpɜːrlɪŋ/","syllables":"Pur-ling"},"inflection":{"verb_forms":{"present_simple":["purl","purls"],"past_simple":"purled","past_participle":"purled","present_participle":"purling"},"noun_plural":null},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"The word 'Purling' has two unrelated main meanings.

It refers to a membrane-bound organelle within cells that functions as a storage compartment. While present in various cell types, it is most notable for its large size and central role in plant cells, where it helps maintain turgor pressure. Understanding this term is essential for advanced biology studies.","priority":"★★★"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The large central **vacuole** occupies a significant portion of the plant cell's volume.","translation":"大きな中心液胞は植物細胞の体積のかなりの部分を占めている。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"液胞"},{"sentence":"The **vacuole** contains cell sap, a solution of sugars, salts, and pigments.","translation":"液胞は細胞液を含み、それは糖、塩、色素の溶液である。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"液胞"},{"sentence":"The contractile **vacuole** in protists helps to regulate water balance.","translation":"原生生物の収縮胞は水分バランスを調整するのを助ける。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"液胞"}]}

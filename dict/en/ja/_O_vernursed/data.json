It describes a situation where someone receives too much care, often to the point where it becomes detrimental. The word is formed by adding the prefix 'over-' to the verb 'nurse,' indicating an excess of nursing care. Understanding the meaning requires familiarity with the base word 'nurse' and the prefix 'over-'. The word is most likely to appear in contexts discussing parenting, healthcare, or personal development, where the balance between care and independence is being considered."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The doctor warned against overnursing the patient, as it could hinder their rehabilitation.","translation":"医師は患者を過剰に看護しないように警告した。それはリハビリの妨げになる可能性があるからだ。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"過剰に看護する"},{"sentence":"The overnursed seedlings were weak and unable to withstand the harsh weather.","translation":"過剰に手入れされた苗は弱く、厳しい天候に耐えることができなかった。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"過剰に看護された"}]}

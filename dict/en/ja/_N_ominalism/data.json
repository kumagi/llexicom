It questions whether abstract concepts (like 'justice', 'beauty', or even 'redness') have any real existence beyond being names or labels we assign to individual things. Nominalists argue that only concrete, particular things exist, and that universals are merely linguistic tools for organizing our thoughts. There are different variations of nominalism, some more radical than others. It's a complex topic with a long history in philosophy, particularly in metaphysics and epistemology.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Nominalism believes in the existence of abstract ideas.","correct":"✓ Nominalism denies the existence of abstract ideas.","note":"Nominalism rejects the independent existence of abstract ideas or universals.

They don't really exist on their own. Only individual things that we can see and touch are real. It's a bit like saying the word 'dog' is real, but the idea of 'dogness' isn't. This idea is often discussed in philosophy classes when talking about what is real and how we understand the world. It's the opposite of realism, which says these general concepts *are* real.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The medieval philosopher William of Ockham was a prominent proponent of **nominalism**.","translation":"中世の哲学者ウィリアム・オッカムは、唯名論の著名な提唱者であった。","type":"general","meaning_category":"philosophy"},{"sentence":"Critics of **nominalism** argue that it struggles to explain how we can have shared understanding of concepts.","translation":"唯名論の批判者たちは、それがどのようにして概念の共通理解を持つことができるのかを説明するのに苦労すると主張する。","type":"general","meaning_category":"philosophy"},{"sentence":"**Nominalism** has implications for how we understand mathematics and logic.","translation":"唯名論は、私たちが数学や論理をどのように理解するかに影響を与える。","type":"general","meaning_category":"philosophy"}]}

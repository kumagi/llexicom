It refers to a substance that prevents the constriction of blood vessels, leading to their dilation. This process can help improve blood flow and lower blood pressure. The term is typically encountered in scientific literature, medical research, and discussions related to cardiovascular health. Understanding the term requires knowledge of basic physiology and medical terminology."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The experimental drug showed promise as a potent vasoinhibitor.","translation":"その実験薬は、強力な血管収縮抑制物質として有望であることが示された。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"血管収縮抑制物質"},{"sentence":"Nitric oxide is a well-known endogenous vasoinhibitor.","translation":"一酸化窒素は、よく知られた内因性の血管収縮抑制物質である。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"血管収縮抑制物質"}]}

It is often used in scientific contexts, particularly in physics and astronomy, to describe phenomena that are difficult or impossible to observe directly due to technological limitations or the nature of the phenomena themselves. It can also be used in more general contexts to describe situations where actions or motives are hidden or difficult to discern.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The unobservability is because of the clouds.","correct":"✓ The unobservability is due to the clouds.","note":"Use \"due to\" or \"because of\" to explain the cause of unobservability."},{"incorrect":"✗ The unobservability of the object was total.","correct":"✓ The object's unobservability was total.","note":"It's more common to use the possessive form to indicate that something *has* unobservability, rather than *is* unobservability."}],"priority":"★☆☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["observable","unobservable","observe","observation"],"phrases":["principle of unobservability"],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"\"Unobservability\" is a complex term typically used in academic or technical contexts.

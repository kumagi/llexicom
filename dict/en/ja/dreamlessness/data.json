It refers to the state of not experiencing dreams during sleep. Due to its specific and somewhat technical nature, it is more likely to be encountered in scientific, medical, or philosophical contexts rather than in everyday conversation. The word's meaning is fairly transparent, being derived from \"dream\" and the suffix \"-less,\" indicating absence.

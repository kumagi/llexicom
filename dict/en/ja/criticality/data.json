It has two main contexts: 1) In nuclear physics, it describes the state of a nuclear reactor when a self-sustaining chain reaction is occurring. 2) More broadly, it describes the degree of importance or urgency of something. It is often used in professional or technical settings to emphasize the significance of a situation, problem, or component. Because of its specialized usage, it's more common in formal or technical writing and speech than in everyday conversation."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The **criticality** of the nuclear reactor must be carefully monitored.","translation":"原子力原子炉の臨界状態は慎重に監視されなければならない。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"臨界状態"},{"sentence":"The **criticality** of the project's deadline required all team members to work overtime.","translation":"プロジェクトの締め切りの重要性から、すべてのチームメンバーが残業する必要があった。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"重要性"},{"sentence":"Due to the **criticality** of the situation, the emergency response team was immediately dispatched.","translation":"事態の重大さから、緊急対応チームが直ちに派遣された。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"重大さ"}]}

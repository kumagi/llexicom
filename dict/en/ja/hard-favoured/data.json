Due to its infrequent usage, it is more likely to be encountered in older literature or historical contexts. The word is a compound adjective, combining 'hard,' suggesting difficulty or unpleasantness, with 'favoured,' referring to facial features or general appearance. Therefore, 'hard-favoured' implies that someone's features are not pleasing or attractive. It is often used as a more polite or euphemistic way of saying someone is ugly or plain-looking."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The old woman was described as hard-favoured, with a wrinkled face and a stern expression.","translation":"その老婆は、しわくちゃの顔と厳しい表情で、顔立ちが悪いと描写された。","type":"descriptive","meaning_category":"appearance"},{"sentence":"Despite being hard-favoured, she possessed a kind and gentle spirit that endeared her to everyone.","translation":"顔立ちが悪かったにもかかわらず、彼女は優しく穏やかな心を持ち、誰からも愛された。","type":"descriptive","meaning_category":"appearance"}]}

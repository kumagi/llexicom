It suggests a high standard of moral or ethical behavior. It is stronger than simply saying something is 'good' or 'acceptable'; it implies that it is beyond reproach. The word is not commonly used in everyday conversation, but it may be found in legal, ethical, or formal contexts.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ He was unreprehensible for the crime.","correct":"✓ He was not reprehensible for the crime. / ✓ His actions were unreprehensible.","note":"\"Unreprehensible\" describes a quality or characteristic, not a direct responsibility. Instead of saying someone *is* unreprehensible *for* something, you would say their *actions* or *behavior* are unreprehensible. To say someone isn't responsible, use 'not reprehensible' or similar phrasing."},{"incorrect":"✗ The unreprehensible act made everyone happy.","correct":"✓ The reprehensible act made everyone angry. / ✓ The exemplary act made everyone happy.","note":"\"Unreprehensible\" means not deserving blame.

It means that something is so good, ethical, or correct that it cannot be criticized or blamed. It's the opposite of \"reprehensible,\" which means deserving blame. Because it's not a common word, it's more likely to be found in formal writing or discussions about ethics, law, or morality. It's important to understand the root word \"reprehensible\" to grasp the meaning of \"unreprehensible.\" "},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The politician maintained an unreprehensible public image throughout his career.","translation":"その政治家はキャリアを通じて、申し分のない公的なイメージを維持した。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"申し分のない"},{"sentence":"The auditor found the company's financial records to be completely unreprehensible.","translation":"監査人は、その会社の財務記録が完全に申し分のないものであることを確認した。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"とがめられる点のない"},{"sentence":"Her conduct during the crisis was deemed unreprehensible by her peers.","translation":"危機の間における彼女の行動は、同僚たちによって非難されるべきではないと判断された。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"非難されるべきでない"}]}

It describes a substance that has been treated to maintain it in a reduced state, meaning it has gained electrons and is less likely to undergo oxidation or other reactions that would change its chemical composition. This is often done to preserve the material's desired properties or functionality. Understanding this term requires a background in chemistry or a related field."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The reduction-stabilized gold clusters showed excellent stability in aqueous solution.","translation":"還元安定化された金クラスターは、水溶液中で優れた安定性を示した。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"化学"},{"sentence":"We developed a new method for creating reduction-stabilized graphene oxide.","translation":"我々は、還元安定化された酸化グラフェンを生成するための新しい方法を開発した。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"材料科学"}]}

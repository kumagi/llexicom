A spectrum is a range of electromagnetic radiation frequencies (or wavelengths) or a similar range of other quantities. Therefore, 'nonspectrally' indicates that the method or analysis does not involve separating or analyzing data based on these frequencies or wavelengths.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The color was nonspectrally.","correct":"✓ The color was analyzed nonspectrally.","note":"'Nonspectrally' is an adverb, so it modifies a verb (action).

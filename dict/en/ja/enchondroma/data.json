They are most commonly found in the small bones of the hands and feet, but can occur in other bones as well. Most enchondromas are asymptomatic and are discovered incidentally on X-rays or other imaging studies performed for other reasons. In some cases, they can cause pain, swelling, or pathological fracture. Treatment typically involves observation, but surgical removal may be necessary if the tumor is symptomatic or shows signs of aggressive behavior.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ enchondroma is a cancerous tumor.","correct":"✓ Enchondroma is a benign tumor.","note":"Enchondromas are benign (non-cancerous) tumors."},{"incorrect":"✗ enchondroma only occurs in adults.","correct":"✓ Enchondromas can occur in both children and adults.","note":"Enchondromas can be found in individuals of all ages, although they are more commonly diagnosed in adults."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":[],"phrasal_verbs":[],"related_conditions":["Ollier disease","Maffucci syndrome"],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Enchondroma' is a medical term referring to a specific type of benign cartilaginous tumor that develops within the bone.

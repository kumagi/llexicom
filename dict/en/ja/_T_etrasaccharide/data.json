They are a type of oligosaccharide, which is a larger category of carbohydrates containing a few (typically 3-10) monosaccharides. Examples of tetrasaccharides include stachyose and scordose. They are less common than simpler sugars like glucose (a monosaccharide) or sucrose (a disaccharide), and more complex carbohydrates like starch (a polysaccharide)."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"Raffinose and stachyose are tetrasaccharides found in beans and other vegetables.","translation":"ラフィノースとスタキオースは豆類や他の野菜に含まれる四糖である。","type":"general","meaning_category":"definition"}]}

'Legislating' comes from 'legislate,' which is derived from the Latin 'lex' (law) + 'latum' (carried, brought forth). Thus, 'self-legislating' literally means 'bringing forth laws for oneself.'","priority":"★☆☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/ˌselfˈledʒɪsleɪtɪŋ/","syllables":"self-leg-is-lat-ing"},"inflection":{"notes":"As an adjective, it does not inflect.

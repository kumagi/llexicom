'War' comes from Old English 'werran', meaning 'to confuse, perplex, embroil'. 'Mongering' comes from the verb 'to monger', meaning 'to deal in a petty or disreputable way', which is derived from Old English 'mangere', meaning 'merchant, trader'. Thus, 'warmongering' literally means 'dealing in war' or 'promoting war for personal gain or other disreputable reasons'.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/ˈwɔːrmʌŋɡərɪŋ/","syllables":"war-mon-ger-ing"},"inflection":{"noun_plural":"warmongerings (rarely used)"},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Warmongering' is a strongly negative term used to criticize individuals, groups, or media outlets that are seen as promoting or inciting war.

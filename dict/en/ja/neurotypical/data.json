It is often used in the context of neurodiversity, which recognizes that neurological differences are normal and valuable variations within the human population.

It's often used when talking about neurodiversity, which is the idea that there's natural variation in how people's brains work. If someone is neurotypical, it means their brain processes information and interacts with the world in a way that is considered standard or typical by society. This term is often used in contrast to 'neurodivergent,' which describes people whose brains function differently, such as those with autism or ADHD. Understanding this term helps in discussions about inclusivity and acceptance of different ways of thinking and behaving."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The company is trying to create a more inclusive environment for both neurotypical and neurodivergent employees.","translation":"その会社は、神経学的に典型的な従業員と神経発達に特性のある従業員の両方にとって、より包括的な環境を作ろうとしています。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"describing individuals with typical neurological development"},{"sentence":"Many social norms are based on neurotypical expectations.","translation":"多くの社会規範は、神経学的に典型的な期待に基づいています。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"describing expectations based on typical neurological development"},{"sentence":"It's important to remember that neurotypical individuals have their own unique strengths and challenges.","translation":"神経学的に典型的な人々には、それぞれ独自の強みと課題があることを覚えておくことが重要です。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"describing individuals with typical neurological development"}]}

'Uncorrupted' is derived from 'corrupted' with the prefix 'un-' (meaning 'not'). 'Corrupted' comes from the verb 'corrupt', which originates from the Latin word 'corrumpere' (to spoil, destroy, corrupt), from 'com-' (intensive prefix) + 'rumpere' (to break). Thus, 'uncorruptedness' literally means 'the state of not being broken or spoiled morally'.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/ˌʌnkəˈrʌptɪdnəs/","syllables":"un-cor-rupt-ed-ness"},"inflection":{"noun_plural":"Uncorruptednesses (rarely used)"},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Uncorruptedness' is a formal and somewhat rare noun that describes the quality or state of being morally pure, honest, and free from corruption.

It's often used in science and engineering when talking about liquids and solids because they don't compress easily. If something has high incompressibility, it means it's very hard to squeeze it into a smaller space. This is important in things like hydraulic systems, where liquids are used to transmit force."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The **incompressibility** of water makes it ideal for use in hydraulic brakes.","translation":"水の非圧縮性により、油圧ブレーキでの使用に最適です。","type":"general"},{"sentence":"The material's **incompressibility** was tested under extreme pressure conditions.","translation":"その材料の非圧縮性は、極端な圧力条件下でテストされました。","type":"technical"},{"sentence":"Understanding the **incompressibility** of different fluids is essential for designing efficient pumps.","translation":"さまざまな流体の非圧縮性を理解することは、効率的なポンプを設計するために不可欠です。","type":"engineering"}]}

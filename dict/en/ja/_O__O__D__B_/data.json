It's a type of database that uses object-oriented programming principles to manage data. This means data is stored as 'objects' which can have properties and methods. OODBs are useful for handling complex data, like multimedia or geographical information, where traditional databases might struggle. They support features like inheritance and polymorphism, making them more flexible for certain applications.","priority":"★★★"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The company decided to migrate to an OODB to better manage their complex data structures.","translation":"会社は、複雑なデータ構造をより適切に管理するために、OODBへの移行を決定しました。","type":"general","meaning_category":"general"},{"sentence":"Implementing an OODB requires a deep understanding of object-oriented principles.","translation":"OODBを実装するには、オブジェクト指向の原則を深く理解する必要があります。","type":"technical","meaning_category":"technical"},{"sentence":"OODBs are often used in CAD/CAM systems for their ability to handle complex geometric data.","translation":"OODBは、複雑な幾何学的データを処理できるため、CAD/CAMシステムでよく使用されます。","type":"application","meaning_category":"application"}]}

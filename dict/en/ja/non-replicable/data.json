It means that something cannot be reliably repeated or reproduced. If an experiment is 'non-replicable,' it means that other scientists cannot follow the same steps and get the same results. This raises questions about the validity of the original experiment. It's a relatively uncommon word in everyday conversation, but important in discussions about research and scientific integrity."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The initial excitement about the new drug faded when subsequent trials showed the results to be **non-replicable**.","translation":"その新薬に対する最初の興奮は、その後の試験で結果が再現不可能であることが示されたときに薄れた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"複製できない"},{"sentence":"The lack of funding for independent verification contributes to the problem of **non-replicable** research.","translation":"独立した検証のための資金不足は、再現不可能な研究の問題に寄与している。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"再現できない"},{"sentence":"Many researchers are working to identify the factors that contribute to **non-replicable** findings in their field.","translation":"多くの研究者は、自分たちの分野で再現不可能な発見に寄与する要因を特定しようと努めている。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"再現できない"}]}

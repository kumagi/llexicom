This structure is stable at high temperatures in carbon steel, but can be retained at room temperature by the addition of elements like nickel and manganese. Austenitic stainless steels are widely used due to their non-magnetic properties, high strength, and excellent corrosion resistance.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{},"related_words":{"derivatives":["austenite"],"related_terms":["ferritic","martensitic"]},"level_frequency":{},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"The word 'austenitic' is a technical term used in materials science and metallurgy to describe a specific type of microstructure in metals, particularly steel.

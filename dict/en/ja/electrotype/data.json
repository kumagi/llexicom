The process involves creating a mold of the original image or text, coating it with a conductive material, and then using electrolysis to deposit a thin layer of metal (typically copper or nickel) onto the mold. This metal layer is then separated from the mold and backed with a stronger metal to create a durable printing plate.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ He used a stereotype instead of electrotype.","correct":"✓ He used an electrotype instead of a stereotype.","note":"'Electrotype' and 'stereotype' are both types of printing plates, but electrotypes are generally considered to be of higher quality and more durable than stereotypes."}],"priority":"★☆☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["electrotyping (noun: 電気鋳造)","electrotyper (noun: 電気鋳造業者)"],"phrasal_verbs":[]},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"N/A (Technical Vocabulary)","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C2","text":"'Electrotype' is a technical term related to printing processes, specifically referring to a printing plate created through electrodeposition.

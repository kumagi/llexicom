When you see \"changefully,\" think of something that is variable, inconstant, or full of variety. It describes how something is done or how something behaves. It is important to distinguish it from the adjective \"changeful,\" which describes something that is full of change or likely to change.","priority":"★☆☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The light flickered changefully across the surface of the water.","translation":"光が水面を変わりやすくちらちらと照らした。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"variably"},{"sentence":"He rearranged the furniture changefully, never quite satisfied with the layout.","translation":"彼は家具を変化に富んで配置し直し、レイアウトに決して満足しなかった。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"variously"},{"sentence":"The political landscape shifted changefully after the election.","translation":"選挙後、政局は変わりやすく推移した。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"unpredictably"}]}

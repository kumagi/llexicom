It is characterized by low concentrations of essential nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus, which limits biological productivity. In microbiology, oligotrophy describes the ability of certain microorganisms to survive and thrive in these nutrient-poor conditions. The opposite of oligotrophy is eutrophy, which describes nutrient-rich conditions that can lead to excessive algal growth and oxygen depletion.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"The river is oligotrophic because it has a lot of algae.","correct":"The river is oligotrophic because it has very little algae.","note":"Oligotrophy means low nutrient levels, which results in low algal growth, not high.

It literally means 'incapable of being fathomed' (measured by a fathom, an old unit of depth), but is almost always used figuratively to represent immense depths – in emotions, mystery, or complexity.  It carries a sense of awe and often a hint of fear because it suggests something beyond human comprehension. You wouldn’t describe a shallow puddle as 'fathomless,' but you might use it for the ocean, grief, or the universe."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The ocean's **fathomless** depths concealed ancient secrets.","translation":"海の底知れない深みは古代の秘密を隠していた。","type":"adjective - describing a physical depth","meaning_category":"物理的な深さ"},{"sentence":"Her grief was **fathomless** after the loss of her husband.","translation":"夫を亡くした彼女の悲しみは底なしだった。","type":"adjective - describing emotional depth","meaning_category":"感情的な深さ"},{"sentence":"The universe is a **fathomless** mystery to humankind.","translation":"宇宙は人類にとって底知れない謎である。","type":"adjective - describing intellectual depth","meaning_category":"知的・概念的な深さ"},{"sentence":"He gazed into her **fathomless** eyes, lost in their depths.","translation":"彼は彼女の底なしの瞳を見つめ、その深みに迷い込んだ。","type":"adjective - describing a quality of character","meaning_category":"性格・性質の深さ"},{"sentence":"The poet explored the **fathomless** complexities of the human soul.","translation":"その詩人は人間の魂の底知れない複雑さを探求した。","type":"adjective - describing abstract depth","meaning_category":"抽象的な深さ"}]}

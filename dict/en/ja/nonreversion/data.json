In materials science, it could describe a material property that remains stable and does not revert to a previous state after being altered.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The nonreversion was very revert.","correct":"✓ The nonreversion was very stable.","note":"\"Nonreversion\" describes the *absence* of reverting.

In meteorology and hydrology, it refers to the various forms of water falling from the sky, such as rain, snow, sleet, and hail. In chemistry, it refers to the process of a solid separating from a liquid solution. The plural form, \"precipitations,\" is less common than the singular form, \"precipitation,\" but can be used to refer to multiple instances or types of precipitation events or chemical reactions.

Hemiapraxia specifically affects one side of the body, making it difficult or impossible for the individual to execute motor tasks on that side. This condition is typically caused by damage to the brain, such as a stroke, traumatic brain injury, or tumor. The affected side is usually contralateral to the side of the brain damage.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The patient has hemiapraxia on their whole body.","correct":"✓ The patient has hemiapraxia on one side of their body.","note":"Hemiapraxia, by definition, affects only one side of the body.

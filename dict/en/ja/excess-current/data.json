This can be caused by short circuits, overloads, or other faults. Protection devices like fuses and circuit breakers are used to interrupt the current flow in an excess-current situation to prevent damage to equipment and wiring, and to reduce the risk of electrical fires.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The current was excess.","correct":"✓ There was an excess-current.","note":"'Excess-current' is a noun, so it needs an article ('an') or to be used as an adjective modifying another noun."},{"incorrect":"✗ The excess current was too much.","correct":"✓ The excess-current was too high.","note":"'Excess-current' already implies 'too much', so saying 'too much' is redundant.

This could refer to the fluttering banners or flags that whifflers sometimes carried, or to their role in clearing the air (literally or figuratively) before a procession. Another theory suggests a connection to 'waffle,' meaning to speak evasively, reflecting the secondary meaning of a whiffler as an unreliable person.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/ˈwɪflər/","syllables":"whif-fler"},"inflection":{"noun_plural":"whifflers"},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"The word 'whiffler' has two distinct meanings, one historical and one archaic. The historical meaning refers to a person who leads a procession, often carrying a staff or weapon to clear the way. This role was particularly common in civic and religious ceremonies.

This Latin term is composed of 'de-' (away from) and 'via' (way or road). The adverbial form 'deviously' thus implies a departure from the straight or honest path.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"ˈdiːviəsli","syllables":"de-vi-ous-ly"},"inflection":{"notes":"As an adverb, 'deviously' does not have different forms like nouns or verbs.

It suggests a deliberate use of tricks or schemes to achieve a goal, often with a negative connotation. The term implies a lack of honesty and a willingness to manipulate or mislead others. It is stronger than simply being 'clever' or 'smart'; it carries a moral judgment of dishonesty.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"He deviously walked down the street.","correct":"He walked deviously around the obstacle.","note":"'Deviously' should describe the *manner* of the action, not the action itself.

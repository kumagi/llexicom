Thus, the word's etymology reflects the act of following or complying to an excessive degree.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/əbˈsiːkwiəsˌnəs/","syllables":"ob-se-qui-ous-ness"},"inflection":{"noun_plural":"obsequiousnesses (rarely used)"},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Obsequiousness' refers to behavior that is excessively eager to please or obey someone, often for personal gain or to gain favor.

This condition arises during sexual reproduction in certain fungi, particularly basidiomycetes (club fungi) and ascomycetes (sac fungi). The two nuclei, originating from different parental cells, coexist without fusing for a period of time. This dikaryotic stage is crucial for genetic recombination and the development of fruiting bodies in these fungi.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The dikaryon has one nucleus.","correct":"✓ The dikaryon has two nuclei.","note":"A dikaryon, by definition, contains two nuclei, not one."},{"incorrect":"✗ Dikaryons are found in all fungi.","correct":"✓ Dikaryons are found in certain fungi, such as basidiomycetes and ascomycetes.","note":"Dikaryons are not a universal feature of all fungi; they are primarily associated with basidiomycetes and ascomycetes."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["dikaryotic (adjective)"],"phrasal_verbs":[]},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency","priority":"★★☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"The term 'dikaryon' is a specialized term used in mycology (the study of fungi).

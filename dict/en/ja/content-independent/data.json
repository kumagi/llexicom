Imagine a machine that sorts shapes. If it sorts them by color, it's not content-independent because it needs to know the color (the content). But if it sorts them by the number of sides, it is content-independent because it only needs to know the shape's structure, not its color. This idea is used in computer science and linguistics to describe systems that can work with different types of data or language without needing to be changed.

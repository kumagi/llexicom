'Flaky' comes from 'flake,' referring to a small, thin piece that comes off a surface. The '-y' suffix indicates a quality or characteristic, so 'flaky' describes something that tends to come off in flakes. The figurative sense of 'unreliable' likely arose from the idea of something easily falling apart or being insubstantial.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/ˈfleɪkiər/","syllables":"fla-ki-er"},"inflection":{"adjective_forms":{"base":"flaky","comparative":"flakier","superlative":"flakiest"}},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Flakier' is primarily used in two contexts: describing the texture of food (especially pastries) and describing the reliability or behavior of a person.

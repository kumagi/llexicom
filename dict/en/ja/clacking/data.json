It's used for things like typewriters, castanets, or even teeth chattering in the cold. It can also describe people talking quickly and noisily, often about unimportant things. Because it's a specific sound, it's not as common as more general sound words like \"noise\" or \"sound.\" It's more likely to be found in descriptive writing where the author wants to create a particular auditory image."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The old train was clacking along the tracks.","translation":"古い列車は線路の上をガタゴトと音を立てて走っていた。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"making a rattling sound"},{"sentence":"I could hear the clacking of their mahjong tiles.","translation":"彼らの麻雀牌がカチャカチャ鳴る音が聞こえた。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"making a rattling sound"},{"sentence":"The gossips were clacking away in the coffee shop.","translation":"おしゃべり好きの人たちは喫茶店でぺちゃくちゃしゃべっていた。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"chattering noisily"}]}

It's used to describe something that is ordinary, average, and doesn't stand out in any way. Because it's a long and somewhat uncommon word, it's more likely to be found in formal writing or academic contexts. Understanding the word requires knowing what 'exceptional' means (being unusual or outstanding) and then understanding that 'un-' negates that meaning, and '-ness' turns it into a noun.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The building's unexceptionalness made it difficult to remember.","translation":"その建物の平凡さが、それを覚えにくくした。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"平凡さ"},{"sentence":"The report highlighted the unexceptionalness of the company's performance compared to its competitors.","translation":"その報告書は、競合他社と比較した会社の業績の平凡さを強調した。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"並外れていないこと"},{"sentence":"Her unexceptionalness allowed her to blend into any crowd without being noticed.","translation":"彼女の平凡さは、誰にも気づかれずにどんな群衆にも溶け込むことを可能にした。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"例外でないこと"}]}

It is formed by adding the prefix \"un-\" to \"birdly,\" meaning not characteristic of or befitting a bird. Its usage is typically found in descriptive or literary contexts where the author wishes to emphasize the contrast between an expected avian quality and the actual behavior or appearance of something. Understanding the word requires familiarity with the root word \"birdly\" and the negating prefix \"un-\". Due to its low frequency, it is unlikely to be encountered in everyday conversation but may appear in more formal or technical writing related to ornithology or zoology."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"Its heavy, earthbound gait was decidedly unbirdly.","translation":"その重く、地に足の着いた歩き方は、明らかに鳥らしくなかった。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"鳥らしくない"},{"sentence":"The creature's awkward attempts at flight were unbirdly and comical.","translation":"その生き物のぎこちない飛行の試みは、鳥らしくなく、滑稽だった。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"鳥にふさわしくない"}]}

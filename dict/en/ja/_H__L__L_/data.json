In comparison to low-level programming languages, it may use natural language elements, be easier to use, or may automate (or even hide entirely) significant areas of computing systems (e.g. memory management), making the process of developing a program simpler and more understandable than when using a lower-level language.","examples":[{"sentence":"Python is a popular HLL known for its readability.","translation":"Pythonは、その読みやすさで知られる人気のある高水準言語です。"},{"sentence":"Using an HLL can significantly reduce development time.","translation":"高水準言語を使用すると、開発時間を大幅に短縮できます。"}],"collocations":["high-level language programming","HLL compiler","HLL interpreter"],"synonyms":["high-level programming language"],"antonyms":["low-level language","assembly language"]}],"etymology":{"value":"Abbreviation of 'High-Level Language'.","priority":"★★★"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/ˌeɪtʃˌɛlˈɛl/","syllables":"Aitch-El-El"},"inflection":{"notes":"It is an acronym, so it doesn't have plural forms."},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'HLL' is primarily used in the context of computer science and software development.

Modulation is used to transmit information over a distance or through a medium more efficiently. The demodulator reverses this process to recover the original information. Demodulators are essential components in communication systems, including radio, television, and data networks.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"The demodulator amplifies the signal.","correct":"The demodulator extracts the signal.","note":"Demodulators extract the original signal, they do not amplify it.

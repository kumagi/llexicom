It describes a cell or organism with three sets of chromosomes, which is an abnormal condition compared to the normal diploid state (two sets of chromosomes). Understanding this term requires knowledge of basic genetics concepts such as chromosomes, ploidy, and meiosis. It is commonly encountered in scientific literature related to plant breeding, genetics research, and studies of chromosomal abnormalities."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The **triploid** banana is seedless, making it more appealing to consumers.","translation":"三倍体バナナは種がないため、消費者にとってより魅力的である。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"describing a seedless fruit"},{"sentence":"Creating a **triploid** fish can prevent it from reproducing in the wild.","translation":"三倍体の魚を作成することで、野生での繁殖を防ぐことができる。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"referring to a sterile organism"}]}

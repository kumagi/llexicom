This happens because of a balance between two forces: one that makes the wave spread out (dispersion) and another that keeps it together (nonlinearity). Solitons are important in many areas of science and technology, like sending information through fiber optic cables. The term is mainly used in advanced scientific discussions.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The experiment demonstrated the stable propagation of **solitons** in the waveguide.","translation":"その実験は、導波路におけるソリトンの安定した伝播を実証しました。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"physics"},{"sentence":"Researchers are exploring the use of **solitons** in high-speed data transmission.","translation":"研究者たちは、高速データ伝送におけるソリトンの利用を研究しています。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"telecommunications"},{"sentence":"The interaction of two **solitons** can result in complex wave patterns.","translation":"二つのソリトンの相互作用は、複雑な波のパターンを生み出す可能性があります。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"physics"}]}

It's not a common word in everyday language, but it's important in medical contexts. Understanding it involves knowing that 'thrombo-' refers to blood clots, and '-philia' means a tendency or affinity towards something. So, thrombophilia is a tendency towards forming blood clots. If someone has this condition, they might be at a higher risk for problems like deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The patient was diagnosed with inherited **thrombophilia** after experiencing a DVT at a young age.","translation":"その患者は、若い頃に深部静脈血栓症を経験した後、遺伝性血栓性素因と診断されました。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"血栓性素因"},{"sentence":"Management of **thrombophilia** often involves the use of anticoagulant medications to reduce the risk of clot formation.","translation":"血栓性素因の管理には、血栓形成のリスクを軽減するために、しばしば抗凝固薬の使用が含まれます。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"血栓性素因"},{"sentence":"Acquired **thrombophilia** can be associated with certain autoimmune disorders or cancers.","translation":"後天性血栓性素因は、特定の自己免疫疾患または癌に関連する可能性があります。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"血栓性素因"}]}

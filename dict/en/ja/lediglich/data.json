It is often used to downplay or limit the importance of something. It's important to understand the context in which it's used, as it can subtly change the meaning of a sentence. While 'nur' is a simpler and more common alternative, 'lediglich' adds a layer of sophistication to your German. It is best used when you want to emphasize the limited scope or significance of something, or when you want to sound more formal or educated."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"Die Reparatur kostete lediglich 10 Euro.","translation":"The repair cost only 10 euros.","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"only"},{"sentence":"Sie hat lediglich gelächelt.","translation":"She merely smiled.","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"merely"},{"sentence":"Das ist lediglich meine Meinung.","translation":"That's just my opinion.","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"just"},{"sentence":"Er ist lediglich ein Freund.","translation":"He is simply a friend.","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"simply"}]}

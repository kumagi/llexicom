It's how you know where your limbs are without looking at them and how you can perform tasks like walking or catching a ball without consciously thinking about every step. This word is more common in scientific or medical contexts, particularly when discussing sensory perception or motor skills. It's a more advanced term than 'sense of touch' or 'body awareness,' so you'll likely encounter it in specialized texts or discussions.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The dancer's exceptional **kinesthesia** allowed her to execute complex routines flawlessly.","translation":"そのダンサーの卓越した運動感覚は、彼女が複雑なルーチンを完璧に実行することを可能にした。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"運動感覚"},{"sentence":"**Kinesthesia** plays a crucial role in motor learning and skill acquisition.","translation":"運動感覚は、運動学習とスキル習得において重要な役割を果たします。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"運動感覚"},{"sentence":"Exercises designed to improve **kinesthesia** can help individuals with movement disorders.","translation":"運動感覚を改善するように設計されたエクササイズは、運動障害のある人々を助けることができる。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"運動感覚"},{"sentence":"The author used **kinesthesia** to describe the feeling of swimming underwater.","translation":"作者は、水中を泳ぐ感覚を表現するために運動感覚を使用した。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"運動感覚的イメージ"}]}

These switches are used to configure the settings of electronic devices. Each switch can be toggled between two positions, typically labeled 'on' and 'off,' allowing for various configurations. DIP switches are less common in modern devices, having been largely replaced by software-based configuration methods. Understanding the purpose and function of DIP switches is primarily relevant for those working with older or specialized electronic equipment."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"To enable the feature, you need to set DIP switch number 3 to the 'on' position.","translation":"その機能を有効にするには、ディップスイッチの3番を「オン」の位置に設定する必要があります。","type":"example","meaning_category":"configuration"},{"sentence":"The DIP switch configuration determines the operating mode of the instrument.","translation":"ディップスイッチの設定が、その機器の動作モードを決定します。","type":"example","meaning_category":"settings"}]}

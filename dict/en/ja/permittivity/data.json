It's a measure of how much a material will reduce the electric field inside it compared to the field in a vacuum. Higher permittivity means the material allows electric fields to pass through more easily. This term is usually encountered in advanced science or engineering contexts."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The **permittivity** of air is close to that of free space.","translation":"空気の誘電率は自由空間の誘電率に近い。","type":"scientific","meaning_category":"physics"},{"sentence":"The high **permittivity** of water makes it a good solvent for ionic compounds.","translation":"水の高い誘電率は、イオン化合物の優れた溶媒としての特性をもたらす。","type":"scientific","meaning_category":"chemistry"}]}

First, it can describe people who spend time doing things in a relaxed and aimless way, often involving small tasks or tinkering. For example, someone might be described as a 'garden putterer' if they enjoy spending time in the garden doing light tasks. Second, in the context of golf, 'putterers' can refer to people who are putting (using a putter to hit the ball into the hole) or less commonly, to multiple putter clubs. The context usually makes it clear which meaning is intended.

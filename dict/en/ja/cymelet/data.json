It is a relatively rare word, primarily used in botanical descriptions and classifications. Understanding this word requires familiarity with botanical terminology, particularly the term 'cyme,' which is a type of inflorescence (flower cluster) where the central or terminal flower blooms first, and subsequent flowers develop as lateral shoots. Therefore, 'cymelet' denotes a smaller version or a subdivision of such a flower cluster."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"Each cymelet in the larger inflorescence bore several tiny flowers.","translation":"大きな花序の中のそれぞれの小集散花序は、いくつかの小さな花をつけた。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"botany"}]}

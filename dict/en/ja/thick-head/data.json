It's a compound word that combines 'thick' and 'head,' implying that the person's skull is so thick that their brain is not functioning properly. This term is quite offensive and should be used with caution, if at all. It's more common to use less harsh words like 'stupid' or 'foolish' in everyday conversation."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"Only a thick-head would make such a mistake.","translation":"そんな間違いをするのは馬鹿だけだ。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"ばか者"},{"sentence":"Don't be so thick-headed; listen to what I'm saying.","translation":"そんなに頭が固くならないで、私の言うことを聞いて。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"頭の鈍い"}]}

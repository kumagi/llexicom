It is used after the addition of coagulants to help small, dispersed particles aggregate into larger, more easily removable flocs. The gentle mixing provided by the flocculator promotes particle contact and floc growth without breaking the flocs apart.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The flocculator is used to filter water directly.","correct":"✓ The flocculator is used to promote the formation of flocs, which are then removed by filtration or sedimentation.","note":"Flocculators do not directly filter water; they aid in the formation of larger particles that can be more easily removed by subsequent processes."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["flocculate (verb)","flocculation (noun)","floc (noun)"],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency.","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"The term 'flocculator' is a technical term primarily used in the context of water and wastewater treatment.

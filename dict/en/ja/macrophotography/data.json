This means that the subject appears life-size or larger on the camera's sensor. It requires specialized equipment, such as macro lenses, and techniques to achieve sharp focus and shallow depth of field. While often used interchangeably with close-up photography, macrophotography has a more specific technical definition related to magnification ratio. It's commonly used to photograph insects, flowers, and other small details that are not easily visible to the naked eye."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"His macrophotography of insects revealed intricate details invisible to the naked eye.","translation":"彼の昆虫のマクロ写真は、肉眼では見えない複雑な細部を明らかにした。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"接写"},{"sentence":"She used a macro lens for her macrophotography.","translation":"彼女はマクロ写真のためにマクロレンズを使用した。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"接写"},{"sentence":"The museum exhibited a collection of stunning macrophotography prints.","translation":"博物館は素晴らしいマクロ写真プリントのコレクションを展示した。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"接写"}]}

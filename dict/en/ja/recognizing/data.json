As a present participle, it is used in continuous verb tenses (e.g., 'She is recognizing...'). As a gerund, it functions as a noun (e.g., 'Recognizing the problem is the first step...'). The verb 'recognize' means to identify someone or something previously known, or to acknowledge the existence or validity of something.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ I am recognizing him now. (stative verb usage)","correct":"✓ I recognize him now.","note":"'Recognize' is generally a stative verb, meaning it describes a state rather than an action. Therefore, it's usually used in the simple present tense rather than the present continuous, unless emphasizing a process of coming to recognition. However, in some contexts, 'recognizing' can be used to emphasize the process of identifying something."},{"incorrect":"✗ Recognizing to the importance of education...","correct":"✓ Recognizing the importance of education...","note":"When 'recognizing' is used as a gerund (noun), it should be followed directly by the object of recognition without the preposition 'to'."},{"incorrect":"✗ He was recognizing of his mistake.","correct":"✓ He was aware of his mistake. / ✓ He recognized his mistake.","note":"The phrase 'recognizing of' is not commonly used.

It's used to describe the act of identifying something or someone previously known, or acknowledging a fact or situation. It's more complex than simply 'seeing' or 'knowing,' as it involves a process of understanding and accepting something. It is often used in formal contexts and writing to convey a deeper understanding or acknowledgment of something important."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"She was **recognizing** the symptoms of the illness.","translation":"彼女はその病気の症状を認識していました。","type":"verb (present participle)","meaning_category":"識別している"},{"sentence":"**Recognizing** the opportunity, he seized it immediately.","translation":"その機会を認識して、彼はすぐにそれを掴みました。","type":"verb (gerund)","meaning_category":"認識すること"},{"sentence":"The government is **recognizing** the importance of renewable energy.","translation":"政府は再生可能エネルギーの重要性を認識しています。","type":"verb (present participle)","meaning_category":"認めている"},{"sentence":"By **recognizing** our mistakes, we can learn from them.","translation":"自分の過ちを認識することで、私たちはそこから学ぶことができます。","type":"verb (gerund)","meaning_category":"認識すること"},{"sentence":"He is **recognizing** the value of hard work.","translation":"彼は努力することの価値を認識しています。","type":"verb (present participle)","meaning_category":"認識している"}]}

It's used in two main ways: literally, to describe things related to the stratosphere (the layer of the atmosphere above the troposphere), and figuratively, to describe something that is extremely high or successful. The figurative use is more common in general writing and speech. Because of its specific and somewhat technical origin, it's not a word that beginners would typically encounter.

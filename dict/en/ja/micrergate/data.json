It combines 'micro-' (small) and a derivative of 'ergate' (to work), suggesting an exaggerated effort or reaction to something insignificant. The term is often used critically to dismiss someone's reaction as disproportionate to the situation. Its usage is largely confined to internet slang and may not be widely understood outside of online communities. Understanding the term requires familiarity with internet culture and slang.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The forum exploded after one user micrergated about the font choice.","translation":"あるユーザーがフォントの選択について些細なことで怒った後、フォーラムは大炎上した。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"過剰に反応する"},{"sentence":"His constant micrergates are exhausting to deal with.","translation":"彼の絶え間ない些細なことで怒ることに対応するのは疲れる。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"過剰な反応"}]}

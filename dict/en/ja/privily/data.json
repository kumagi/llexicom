It's not commonly used in everyday conversation. You're more likely to encounter it in older books or historical contexts. If you want to say something was done secretly, it's usually better to use the word 'secretly' instead, as it's more common and easier to understand. For example, instead of saying 'They met privily,' you could say 'They met secretly.'"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The king and his advisor conferred **privily** in the royal chambers.","translation":"王と顧問は王室の部屋で内密に協議した。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"内密に"},{"sentence":"She learned of the plot **privily** through a trusted friend.","translation":"彼女は信頼できる友人を通して、その陰謀についてひそかに知った。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"ひそかに"},{"sentence":"The details of the agreement were discussed **privily** before being made public.","translation":"合意の詳細は、公表される前に内密に話し合われた。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"内密に"}]}

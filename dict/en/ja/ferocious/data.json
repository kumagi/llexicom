It often implies a wild, untamed nature. While it can be used literally for animals (a ferocious lion), it's also frequently employed figuratively to describe intense emotions, strong competition, or powerful forces.  It’s stronger than simply 'fierce'; it suggests a savage and potentially dangerous quality. Be mindful that while sometimes used dramatically, it generally has negative connotations unless specifically describing something admired for its strength (e.g., a ferocious competitor)."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The lion was a **ferocious** hunter, feared by all the animals in the savanna.","translation":"そのライオンは獰猛なハンターで、サバンナのすべての動物に恐れられていた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"literal - animal"},{"sentence":"The storm unleashed **ferocious** winds and torrential rain.","translation":"嵐は猛烈な風と激しい雨を解き放った。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"figurative - force of nature"},{"sentence":"She fought with **ferocious** determination to win the championship.","translation":"彼女は選手権で勝つために激しい決意を持って戦った。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"figurative - emotion/effort"},{"sentence":"He gave a **ferocious** critique of the government's policies.","translation":"彼は政府の政策に対して激しい批判を行った。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"figurative - strong opinion/attack"},{"sentence":"The **ferocious** debate lasted for hours, with both sides refusing to yield.","translation":"激しい議論は数時間続き、両者とも一歩も譲らなかった。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"figurative - competition/argument"}]}

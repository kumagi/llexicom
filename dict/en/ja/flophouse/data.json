It suggests a place where people who are down on their luck might stay, often with minimal comfort and cleanliness. It's not a word you would use to describe a regular hotel; it implies a place of last resort. Because of its specific and somewhat negative connotation, it's not a word that is commonly used in everyday conversation, but you might encounter it in literature or historical contexts.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The old man had nowhere else to go, so he checked into the **flophouse**.","translation":"その老人は他にどこへも行く場所がなかったので、その安宿にチェックインした。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"安宿"},{"sentence":"The **flophouse** was filled with the smell of stale cigarettes and despair.","translation":"その安宿は、タバコの吸い殻と絶望の匂いで満たされていた。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"安宿"},{"sentence":"He had hit rock bottom and was living in a **flophouse**.","translation":"彼はどん底に落ち、安宿で暮らしていた。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"安宿"}]}

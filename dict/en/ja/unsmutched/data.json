It's formed by adding the prefix 'un-' to 'smutched,' which is the past participle of 'smutch' (to mark or stain with dirt). Due to its rarity, it's unlikely to be encountered in everyday language and is more likely to appear in older literature or specialized contexts where precise description of cleanliness is required."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The artist carefully kept the canvas unsmutched during the painting process.","translation":"画家は絵を描く過程で、キャンバスが汚れないように注意深く保った。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"汚れていない"},{"sentence":"Her pristine white gloves remained unsmutched, a testament to her meticulousness.","translation":"彼女の真っ白な手袋は汚れることなく、彼女の几帳面さを示していた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"汚れていない"}]}

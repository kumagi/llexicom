It describes two shapes or spaces that can be transformed into each other through continuous deformation, meaning stretching, bending, twisting, etc., without cutting or gluing. The key idea is that the fundamental structure remains the same, even if the appearance changes. It is synonymous with 'homeomorphic', which is the more commonly used term.

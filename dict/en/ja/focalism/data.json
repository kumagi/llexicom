They tend to focus too much on one particular event they are thinking about and forget to consider all the other things that will be happening in their lives at the same time. This can lead them to believe that a single event will have a much bigger impact on their overall happiness than it actually does. It is often discussed in the context of 'affective forecasting,' which is the study of how people predict their future emotions."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"Due to focalism, she overestimated how happy she would be after getting a promotion.","translation":"焦点的思考のために、彼女は昇進後に自分がどれだけ幸せになるかを過大評価しました。","type":"general","meaning_category":"cognitive bias"},{"sentence":"The study demonstrated that focalism contributes to the impact bias in emotional predictions.","translation":"その研究は、焦点的思考が感情予測におけるインパクトバイアスに寄与することを示しました。","type":"research","meaning_category":"psychology"}]}

It's a complex word used in legal and political discussions. You'll often find it when people are talking about laws, government actions, or court decisions that might not follow the rules set out in the constitution. It's formed by adding the prefix 'un-' (meaning 'not') to 'constitutionally', which itself is derived from 'constitution'. This word is less common in everyday conversation and more likely to appear in formal writing or academic discussions."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The defendant argued that the evidence had been obtained unconstitutionally and should be excluded from the trial.","translation":"被告は、その証拠は違憲に取得されたものであり、裁判から除外されるべきだと主張した。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"違憲に"},{"sentence":"The president's actions were criticized as unconstitutionally exceeding his authority.","translation":"大統領の行動は、違憲に彼の権限を超えているとして批判された。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"違憲に"},{"sentence":"The law was challenged in court for being unconstitutionally vague.","translation":"その法律は、違憲に曖昧であるとして法廷で異議を申し立てられた。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"違憲に"}]}

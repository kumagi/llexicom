'Contiguus' is derived from 'con-' (meaning 'together') and 'tangere' (meaning 'to touch').

It is often used in technical or formal contexts to emphasize the unbroken nature of a connection or arrangement. It is important to distinguish it from 'continuously,' which means without interruption but does not necessarily imply physical adjacency.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The data was stored continuously on the disk.","correct":"✓ The data was stored contiguously on the disk.","note":"'Continuously' means without interruption in time, whereas 'contiguously' means without gaps in space or sequence.

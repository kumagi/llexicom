However, in certain contexts, such as in professional settings or during crises, unemotionality can be seen as a positive trait, indicating composure and rationality.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"He showed unemotional.","correct":"He showed unemotionality. / He was unemotional.","note":"'Unemotionality' is a noun, so it needs to be used as such.

It's often used in psychological or clinical contexts. To understand it, think of someone who remains calm and detached even in stressful situations. This person exhibits unemotionality.

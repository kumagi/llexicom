It is composed of two dissimilar metals joined at one end, creating a junction. When this junction experiences a temperature difference compared to a reference point, a voltage is generated, which is then measured to determine the temperature. Thermopairs are commonly used in various industrial and scientific applications due to their wide temperature range and durability."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The **thermopair** was used to monitor the temperature of the furnace.","translation":"その熱電対は炉の温度を監視するために使用された。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"熱電対"},{"sentence":"The output voltage of the **thermopair** is proportional to the temperature difference.","translation":"熱電対の出力電圧は温度差に比例する。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"熱電対"}]}

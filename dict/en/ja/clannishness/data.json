'Clan' originates from the Scottish Gaelic word 'clann,' meaning 'children' or 'family.' The suffix '-ish' implies a characteristic or tendency, and '-ness' turns it into a noun denoting a state or quality. Therefore, 'clannishness' describes the quality of behaving like a tightly-knit, exclusive clan.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/ˈklænɪʃnəs/","syllables":"clan-nish-ness"},"inflection":{"noun_plural":"clannishnesses (rarely used)"},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Clannishness' refers to the tendency of a group to be exclusive and favor its own members, often to the detriment of outsiders. It implies a strong sense of loyalty and solidarity within the group, but also a resistance to those who are not part of it. This term often carries a negative connotation, suggesting that such behavior is unfair or detrimental to broader society. It is often used in discussions about social dynamics, organizational behavior, and cultural attitudes.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The team's clannishness helped them win the game.","correct":"✓ The team's cohesiveness helped them win the game.","note":"While clannishness implies a strong bond, it often has negative connotations of exclusion.

If the intention is to describe a community that is simply tightly-knit and supportive, 'close-knit community' is a better choice."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["clannish (adjective)","clan (noun)"],"related_concepts":["groupthink","tribalism","in-group/out-group bias","social exclusion","nepotism","favoritism"],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Clannishness' is a relatively uncommon word that describes the quality of a group being exclusive and favoring its own members.

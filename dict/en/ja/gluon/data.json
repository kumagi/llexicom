They bind quarks together to form hadrons, such as protons and neutrons, and also hold atomic nuclei together. Gluons themselves carry color charge, which means they can interact with each other, making the strong force very complex.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Gluons hold atoms together.","correct":"✓ Gluons hold atomic nuclei together.","note":"Gluons directly act on the atomic nuclei, not the entire atom."},{"incorrect":"✗ Gluons have electric charge.","correct":"✓ Gluons have color charge.","note":"Gluons have color charge, not electric charge."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":[],"related_terms":["quantum chromodynamics (QCD)","color charge","fundamental forces","particle physics"]},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"The term 'gluon' is a specialized term in particle physics. It refers to the elementary particle that carries the strong force, which binds quarks together to form protons and neutrons. Understanding gluons requires a background in physics, particularly quantum chromodynamics (QCD). The concept involves abstract properties like 'color charge' and interactions between particles at a subatomic level.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The strong force, mediated by **gluons**, binds quarks together within protons and neutrons.","translation":"強い力はグルーオンによって媒介され、クォークを陽子や中性子の中にまとめます。","type":"scientific","meaning_category":"particle physics"},{"sentence":"Scientists study **gluon** interactions to better understand the properties of nuclear matter.","translation":"科学者たちは核物質の特性をより良く理解するためにグルーオンの相互作用を研究しています。","type":"scientific","meaning_category":"particle physics"}]}

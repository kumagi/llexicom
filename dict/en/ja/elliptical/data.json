The mathematical sense is from Apollonius of Perga (3rd century BC), who used the term to describe the conic section formed when a plane cuts a cone at an angle less steep than that required to form a parabola. The sense of 'characterized by ellipsis or omission' is first recorded in 1869.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/ɪˈlɪptɪkəl/","syllables":"el-lip-ti-cal"},"inflection":{"notes":"Adjective; comparative and superlative forms are 'more elliptical' and 'most elliptical', respectively."},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"The word \"elliptical\" has two main meanings.

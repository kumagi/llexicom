It describes something that is designed to be aware of and responsive to dependencies. A dependency is a relationship where one thing relies on another. For example, in software, one module might depend on another module to function correctly. A dependency-sensitive system is one that understands these relationships and can handle them appropriately, such as by ensuring that modules are loaded in the correct order or by rebuilding only the parts of the system that are affected by a change. This term requires a good understanding of technical concepts related to software development."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The new build system is dependency-sensitive, so it only recompiles files that have changed.","translation":"新しいビルドシステムは依存関係を考慮するため、変更されたファイルのみを再コンパイルする。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"依存関係を考慮する"},{"sentence":"A dependency-sensitive task scheduler can improve performance by executing tasks in the optimal order.","translation":"依存関係を考慮したタスクスケジューラは、最適な順序でタスクを実行することにより、パフォーマンスを向上させることができる。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"依存関係を考慮する"},{"sentence":"The compiler performs dependency-sensitive analysis to optimize code generation.","translation":"コンパイラは、コード生成を最適化するために、依存関係を考慮した分析を実行する。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"依存関係を考慮する"}]}

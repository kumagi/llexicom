This means they exhibit a pattern that repeats approximately, but not with perfect regularity. The term is commonly used in fields like physics, mathematics, and engineering to describe complex systems. Understanding this term requires a good grasp of the concept of periodicity and the meaning of the prefix 'quasi-'.

It refers to the property of a material that prevents it from undergoing nuclear fission, a process where the nucleus of an atom splits into two or more smaller nuclei, releasing energy. This term is typically encountered in advanced scientific or technical contexts related to nuclear reactors, nuclear waste management, and nuclear safety. Understanding this term requires a background in nuclear science or a related field."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The high nonfissility of the alloy makes it safe for long-term storage of radioactive waste.","translation":"その合金の高い非核分裂性により、放射性廃棄物の長期保管に安全です。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"非核分裂性"}]}

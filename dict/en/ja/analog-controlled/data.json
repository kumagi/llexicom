This often implies a more direct, immediate, and sometimes less precise form of control compared to digital systems. It's commonly used in contexts like audio equipment, older electronic systems, and situations where a 'hands-on' feel is desired.","priority":"N/A"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"The analog-controlled computer is very modern.","correct":"The analog-controlled device is a vintage synthesizer.","note":"Analog control is more associated with older or specialized equipment, not modern computers."}],"priority":"N/A"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["analog","control","controlled"],"phrasal_verbs":[],"related_terms":["analog signal","analog circuit","digital-controlled","voltage-controlled"]},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"N/A","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency.","priority":"N/A"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"B2","text":"'Analog-controlled' means something is controlled by continuous signals, like voltage, instead of digital (on/off) signals.

It is often used in conjunction with skewness to fully characterize the shape of a distribution. High kurtosis indicates a distribution with a sharp peak and heavy tails, meaning there are more extreme values (outliers) compared to a normal distribution. Low kurtosis indicates a flatter distribution with thinner tails. The kurtosis of a normal distribution is 3, and excess kurtosis is calculated by subtracting 3 from the kurtosis value.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Kurtosis measures the symmetry of the distribution.","correct":"✓ Skewness measures the symmetry of the distribution.

The suffix '-ify' means 'to make' or 'to become'. Therefore, 'objectify' means 'to make into an object'. The concept gained prominence in feminist theory, particularly in the 20th century, to describe the treatment of individuals as mere objects, often for sexual gratification.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/əbˈdʒɛktɪfaɪd/","syllables":"ob-jec-ti-fied"},"inflection":{"verb_forms":{"present_simple":["objectify","objectifies"],"past_simple":"objectified","past_participle":"objectified","present_participle":"objectifying"}},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Objectified' is most commonly used in discussions about feminism, sociology, and media studies. It describes the act of reducing a person to their physical attributes or their ability to serve a purpose, disregarding their individuality, thoughts, and feelings.

The term carries a negative connotation, highlighting the disrespect and devaluation of the individual being objectified.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ He objectified the situation.","correct":"✓ He analyzed the situation objectively.","note":"'Objectify' is generally used to describe the treatment of a *person* as an object, not a situation.

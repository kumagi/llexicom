Hemoglobin transports oxygen in the blood, while myoglobin stores oxygen in muscles. Globin binds to heme, which contains iron, and this allows the binding and transport of oxygen. Different types of globin chains exist, such as alpha and beta globin, which combine to form the complete hemoglobin molecule.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Globin is a type of heme.","correct":"✓ Globin binds to heme.","note":"Globin is a protein, while heme is a porphyrin ring containing iron.

It can describe plants affected by canker, a disease that causes lesions or growths. It can also describe a person's disposition, meaning ill-tempered, irritable, or cross. Because of its infrequent use, it is more likely to be encountered in older literature or specialized contexts related to botany or plant pathology. When describing a person's mood, more common synonyms like 'irritable' or 'grumpy' are generally preferred in modern English."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The roses were afflicted with a cankery blight.","translation":"バラはがん腫病に悩まされていた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"がん腫のある"},{"sentence":"His cankery disposition made him difficult to work with.","translation":"彼の気難しい性格は、彼との仕事を困難にした。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"気難しい"}]}

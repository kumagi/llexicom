Generally, 'epilatory' refers to products or methods that remove the entire hair, including the part below the skin's surface (e.g., waxing, sugaring, epilators). 'Depilatory', on the other hand, often refers to products that remove hair only at the skin's surface (e.g., shaving, depilatory creams).

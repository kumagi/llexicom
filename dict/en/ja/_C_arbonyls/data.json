This group consists of a carbon atom double-bonded to an oxygen atom. Carbonyl compounds are widespread in organic chemistry and biochemistry and include aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids, esters, amides, and acyl halides. The reactivity of carbonyl compounds is largely determined by the polarity of the carbonyl group, with the carbon atom being electrophilic and the oxygen atom being nucleophilic.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Carbonyl is a group of chemical compounds.","correct":"✓ Carbonyls are a group of chemical compounds.","note":"'Carbonyls' is the plural form and refers to the class of compounds.

It is commonly used in the context of food processing and image processing. In food processing, it involves altering a food's structure to remove its original texture, often to create a smoother or more uniform product. In image processing, it refers to techniques that smooth or remove texture from images, which can be useful for various analysis or enhancement tasks.","priority":"high"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"The de-texturization added more texture to the food.","correct":"The de-texturization removed texture from the food.","note":"De-texturization removes, it doesn't add texture."}],"priority":"medium"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["de-texturize (verb)"],"phrasal_verbs":[]},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"low","priority":"low"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"\"De-texturization\" is a technical term primarily used in food science and image processing. It describes the process of removing or reducing texture from a substance or image. Understanding this term requires familiarity with technical vocabulary related to these fields.

This can involve using browser-specific features, workarounds for browser-specific bugs, or tailoring content to match the capabilities of a certain browser.

It means that a website or web application is specifically designed to work well with a particular web browser. This might be done to take advantage of specific features of that browser, or to work around problems with how that browser handles web standards. However, it can also mean that the website might not work as well in other browsers. Modern web development generally aims for cross-browser compatibility, meaning that websites should work well in all major browsers, rather than being browser-targeted."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The new feature is browser-targeted, so it only works in Chrome.","translation":"その新機能はブラウザを対象としているため、Chromeでのみ動作します。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"specific browser functionality"},{"sentence":"Browser-targeted code can be difficult to maintain due to browser updates.","translation":"ブラウザを対象としたコードは、ブラウザのアップデートによりメンテナンスが困難になる場合があります。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"maintenance challenges"},{"sentence":"They used browser-targeted hacks to fix rendering issues in older versions of IE.","translation":"彼らは、古いバージョンのIEでのレンダリングの問題を修正するために、ブラウザを対象としたハックを使用しました。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"workarounds for rendering issues"}]}

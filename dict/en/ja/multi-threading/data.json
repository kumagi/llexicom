Think of it like a chef who can cook multiple dishes simultaneously instead of one at a time. This can make programs faster and more efficient. However, it also makes programming more complex, as you need to ensure that the different threads don't interfere with each other, leading to errors like race conditions or deadlocks. It's a concept typically encountered in advanced programming courses or when dealing with high-performance computing.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The server uses **multi-threading** to handle multiple client connections simultaneously.","translation":"サーバーは、複数のクライアント接続を同時に処理するためにマルチスレッディングを使用しています。","type":"general","meaning_category":"Definition"},{"sentence":"Implementing **multi-threading** requires careful synchronization to avoid data corruption.","translation":"マルチスレッディングを実装するには、データ破損を避けるために慎重な同期が必要です。","type":"implementation","meaning_category":"Implementation"},{"sentence":"**Multi-threading** can significantly improve the responsiveness of GUI applications.","translation":"マルチスレッディングは、GUIアプリケーションの応答性を大幅に向上させることができます。","type":"performance","meaning_category":"Performance"},{"sentence":"Debugging **multi-threading** issues can be challenging due to their non-deterministic nature.","translation":"マルチスレッディングの問題をデバッグすることは、その非決定的な性質のために困難な場合があります。","type":"debugging","meaning_category":"Debugging"}]}

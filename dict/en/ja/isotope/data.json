This means they have the same atomic number but different mass numbers. Some isotopes are stable, while others are radioactive and decay over time. Radioactive isotopes are used in various applications, including medical imaging, cancer treatment, and carbon dating.

This difference in neutron count results in variations in atomic mass among isotopes of the same element. While isotopes exhibit nearly identical chemical behaviors, their physical properties, such as stability and radioactive decay, can vary significantly. Understanding isotopes is crucial in fields like nuclear chemistry, geology (for dating materials), and medicine (for diagnostic imaging and treatment). The concept builds upon basic knowledge of atomic structure and the periodic table.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"Uranium has several **isotopes**, some of which are used in nuclear reactors.","translation":"ウランにはいくつかの同位体があり、そのうちのいくつかは原子炉で使用されています。","type":"general","meaning_category":"definition"},{"sentence":"**Isotope** analysis can provide valuable information about the origin of a sample.","translation":"同位体分析は、試料の起源に関する貴重な情報を提供することができます。","type":"application","meaning_category":"application"},{"sentence":"The ratio of carbon-12 to carbon-14 **isotopes** is used to determine the age of organic materials.","translation":"炭素12と炭素14の同位体比は、有機物の年代を決定するために使用されます。","type":"dating","meaning_category":"dating"},{"sentence":"Doctors use radioactive **isotopes** to diagnose certain medical conditions.","translation":"医師は、特定の病状を診断するために放射性同位体を使用します。","type":"medical","meaning_category":"medical"}]}

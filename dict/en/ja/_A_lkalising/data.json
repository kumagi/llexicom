In American English, 'alkalizing' is the preferred spelling. The term refers to the process of increasing the pH level of a substance, making it more alkaline (or basic) and less acidic. It is often used in the context of diet and health, where certain foods or practices are claimed to have an alkalising effect on the body. However, it's important to note that the body has its own mechanisms for maintaining pH balance, and the extent to which diet can significantly alter overall body pH is a subject of ongoing debate.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The alkalising is good for you.","correct":"✓ The alkalising diet is good for you. / ✓ Alkalising is a process.","note":"'Alkalising' is a verb form (present participle) or can function as a gerund.

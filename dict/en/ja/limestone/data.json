It often contains skeletal fragments of marine organisms such as coral, foraminifera, and molluscs. It is a common building material and is also used in the production of cement, lime (calcium oxide), and other industrial products. Limestone landscapes are often characterized by karst topography, including caves, sinkholes, and underground drainage systems.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ I built my house of lime stone.","correct":"✓ I built my house of limestone.","note":"'Limestone' is one word, not two.

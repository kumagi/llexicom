It's not a common word, so you'll mostly find it in more advanced texts when the writer wants to emphasize the feeling of being freed from something. Think of it as doing something with a sigh of relief or a weight lifted off your shoulders. It's formed by adding '-ingly' to the adjective form of 'release,' indicating the manner in which something is done.

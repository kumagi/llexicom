'Surfaced' is derived from 'surface', which comes from Old French 'surface' (n.), from Medieval Latin 'superficies' (the top or outermost part of a thing), from Latin 'super' (above) + 'facies' (form, face).

It's not a very common word, so you're more likely to see or use 'superficially' instead. If something is done 'surfacedly', it means it's done without much depth or sincerity, just on the surface. Because it's rare, using simpler words like 'superficially' or 'outwardly' can make your writing clearer."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"He surfacedly expressed his condolences, but his eyes betrayed his lack of empathy.","translation":"彼は表面上は哀悼の意を表したが、その目は共感の欠如を物語っていた。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"うわべだけは"},{"sentence":"The company surfacedly supported the environmental initiative, but their actions showed otherwise.","translation":"その会社は表面上は環境保護の取り組みを支持していたが、彼らの行動はそうではなかった。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"表面上は"}]}

It's primarily used to release external resources held by the object. However, finalizers have limitations: their execution is not guaranteed, and they can negatively impact performance. Therefore, it's generally recommended to use deterministic disposal mechanisms like 'dispose' methods instead. Outside of programming, a finalizer is simply someone who completes or makes the final decision on something.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The finalizer is called when the object is created.","correct":"✓ The finalizer is called when the object is about to be garbage collected.","note":"Finalizers are called just *before* garbage collection, not during object creation."},{"incorrect":"✗ Finalizers are a reliable way to release resources.","correct":"✓ Finalizers are *not* a reliable way to release resources.

In general usage, it refers to someone who completes a task or makes a final decision. However, it's most commonly used in the context of programming, specifically in languages with garbage collection. A finalizer is a special method that runs just before an object is removed from memory by the garbage collector. It's used to clean up resources, but its use is discouraged in favor of more predictable methods like 'dispose' due to performance and reliability concerns. Understanding the context is key to interpreting the meaning of 'finalizer' correctly."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The C# language provides a mechanism called a finalizer for releasing unmanaged resources.","translation":"C#言語は、アンマネージリソースを解放するためのファイナライザと呼ばれるメカニズムを提供します。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"programming"},{"sentence":"As the project's finalizer, she ensured all loose ends were tied up before the deadline.","translation":"プロジェクトの最終決定者として、彼女は締め切り前にすべての未解決の問題が解決されていることを確認しました。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"general"}]}

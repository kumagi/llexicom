Se debe usar 'desalinearse': La foto se desalineó.","note":"'Desalinear' is a transitive verb, meaning it takes a direct object. 'Desalinearse' is reflexive, meaning the subject and object are the same. Therefore, you don't 'desalinear' something, something 'desalinea' itself (se desalinea)."},{"incorrect":"Yo desalineo.","correct":"Yo me desalineo.","note":"Because it is a reflexive verb, you must use the reflexive pronoun (me, te, se, nos, os, se) with 'desalinearse'."}],"priority":"N/A"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"N/A","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency.","priority":"N/A"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"B2","text":"'Desalinearse' is a verb that means to lose alignment or to disaffiliate from something. It's often used in political or social contexts to describe a separation from a group or ideology. The reflexive pronoun ('se') indicates that the subject is performing the action on itself. It's important to use the reflexive form correctly, as the non-reflexive form 'desalinear' has a different meaning (to misalign something)."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"Con el tiempo, la puerta se desalineó y ya no cerraba bien.","translation":"Over time, the door became misaligned and no longer closed properly.","type":"physical alignment","meaning_category":"physical alignment"},{"sentence":"Muchos votantes jóvenes han empezado a desalinearse de los partidos tradicionales.","translation":"Many young voters have started to disaffiliate from traditional parties.","type":"political/ideological alignment","meaning_category":"political/ideological alignment"},{"sentence":"Después de la crisis económica, muchos países decidieron desalinearse de las políticas neoliberales.","translation":"After the economic crisis, many countries decided to disaffiliate from neoliberal policies.","type":"political/economic alignment","meaning_category":"political/economic alignment"}]}

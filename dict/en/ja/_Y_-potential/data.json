No plural form typically used."},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"The term 'Y-potential' is likely a misspelling or a non-standard term. The correct and widely accepted term is 'zeta potential'. Zeta potential is a crucial parameter for characterizing the stability of colloidal systems. It quantifies the magnitude of the electrostatic repulsion or attraction between particles, which affects their tendency to aggregate or remain dispersed. A high zeta potential (either positive or negative) indicates strong repulsive forces, leading to a stable dispersion. A low zeta potential indicates that attractive forces may dominate, causing aggregation and instability.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The Y-potential was zero, so the solution was stable.","correct":"✓ The zeta potential was zero, so the solution was unstable.","note":"A zero or very low zeta potential typically indicates instability, not stability.

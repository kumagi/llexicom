These objects bundle data (attributes) and the code that operates on that data (methods). Key principles of object-orientation include encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

It describes a way of designing software by organizing it into 'objects,' which are like self-contained units that have both data and actions. Key ideas include grouping data and actions together (encapsulation), creating new objects based on existing ones (inheritance), and allowing objects to take on different forms (polymorphism). This approach helps make software easier to manage and reuse, especially in large projects.

It suggests re-experiencing a past event or memory while asleep. Because it's not a frequently used word, it's more likely to appear in literature or creative writing where the author wants to convey the idea of revisiting a dream. It's important to distinguish it from simply 'dreaming,' which refers to the general act of having dreams."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"He closed his eyes, hoping to **redream** the comforting scene.","translation":"彼は目を閉じ、その心地よい光景を再び夢見ることを願った。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"再び夢を見る"},{"sentence":"Sometimes, I **redream** the same nightmare, night after night.","translation":"時々、私は同じ悪夢を毎晩のように再び夢に見る。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"再び夢を見る"},{"sentence":"She longed to **redream** their first meeting.","translation":"彼女は彼らの最初の出会いを再び夢見ることを切望した。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"再び夢を見る"}]}

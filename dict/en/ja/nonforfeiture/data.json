'Forfeiture' comes from the Old French 'forfeture,' meaning 'a crime, offense; something forfeited,' which in turn comes from 'forfaire,' meaning 'to commit a crime, trespass,' ultimately from Latin 'foris facere' meaning 'to do amiss, transgress,' literally 'to do outside.'","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/ˌnɒn.fɔːrˈfɪtʃər/","syllables":"non-for-fi-ture"},"inflection":{"noun_plural":"nonforfeitures"},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Nonforfeiture' refers specifically to provisions in insurance policies, particularly life insurance, that protect the policyholder's investment even if they can no longer pay premiums. These provisions prevent the policyholder from losing all the value accumulated in the policy.

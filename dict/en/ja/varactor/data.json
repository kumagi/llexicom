It is commonly used in electronic tuning applications, such as in radio receivers and voltage-controlled oscillators (VCOs). The capacitance of a varactor changes in response to the applied reverse voltage; increasing the reverse voltage decreases the capacitance, and vice versa. This property allows for precise electronic control of resonant frequencies in circuits.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The varactor is used to amplify signals.","correct":"✓ The varactor is used to tune circuits.","note":"Varactors are used for tuning, not amplification."},{"incorrect":"✗ The varactor has a fixed capacitance.","correct":"✓ The varactor has a variable capacitance.","note":"The key feature of a varactor is its variable capacitance."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["varicap (short for variable capacitor, often used interchangeably with varactor)"],"related_concepts":["diode","capacitance","reverse bias","voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO)","tuning circuit"],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency - specialized technical term.","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"A **varactor** is a specialized electronic component, specifically a type of diode.

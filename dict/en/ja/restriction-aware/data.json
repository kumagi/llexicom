'Restriction' comes from the Latin 'restrictio,' meaning 'a binding tight.' 'Aware' comes from Old English 'gewær,' meaning 'watchful, wary.' The combination indicates a state of being mindful and considerate of limitations or constraints.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/rɪˈstrɪkʃən əˈwɛər/","syllables":"re-stric-tion a-ware"},"inflection":{"notes":"This is an adjective, so it does not inflect in the same way as verbs or nouns. Comparative and superlative forms would be 'more restriction-aware' and 'most restriction-aware', respectively."},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Restriction-aware' is often used in technical contexts, particularly in software development, engineering, and design. It emphasizes that a system, algorithm, or design has been created with a deep understanding of the limitations or constraints it will operate under. This awareness allows for more efficient and effective solutions. The term highlights a proactive approach to problem-solving, where potential limitations are considered from the outset rather than being addressed as afterthoughts.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The system is restriction aware.","correct":"✓ The system is restriction-aware.","note":"The hyphen is important to show that 'restriction' and 'aware' are combined to form a single adjective modifying the noun. Without the hyphen, the phrase can be misinterpreted. "},{"incorrect":"✗ The design is very restriction aware.","correct":"✓ The design is highly restriction-aware. / ✓ The design is very aware of restrictions.","note":"While 'very' can be used, 'highly restriction-aware' is more common and precise.

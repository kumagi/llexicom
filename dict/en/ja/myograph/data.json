It serves the purpose of precisely measuring and recording the mechanical activity of muscles, such as the force, duration, and speed of contractions. Due to its technical nature and specific application, the term is primarily encountered in academic or research contexts. Understanding the function of a myograph requires a background in biology or a related scientific discipline.","priority":"★☆☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The researchers used a **myograph** to analyze the effects of the drug on skeletal muscle.","translation":"研究者たちは、骨格筋に対する薬物の影響を分析するためにミオグラフを使用した。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"筋活動記録器"},{"sentence":"The **myograph** recorded the isometric contractions of the muscle.","translation":"ミオグラフは、筋肉の等尺性収縮を記録した。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"筋活動記録器"}]}

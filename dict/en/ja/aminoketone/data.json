The amino and ketone groups can be located at various positions within the molecule, leading to different types of aminoketones, such as alpha-aminoketones (amino group adjacent to the ketone) and beta-aminoketones (amino group two carbons away from the ketone). These compounds are useful in organic synthesis as building blocks for more complex molecules.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[],"priority":"☆☆☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["amino acid","ketone","organic compound"],"phrasal_verbs":[]},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"The term 'aminoketone' refers to a specific type of organic compound used in chemistry.

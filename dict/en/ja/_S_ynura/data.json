These colonies are composed of individual cells, each covered with siliceous scales (also called silica scales or scales). These scales can be observed using electron microscopy and are important for species identification. Synura species are often associated with taste and odor problems in drinking water supplies due to the production of volatile organic compounds during algal blooms.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Synura are a algae.","correct":"✓ Synura is a genus of algae.","note":"Synura is a genus (singular), so the verb should be 'is'."},{"incorrect":"✗ Synura have silica scales.","correct":"✓ Synura has silica scales.","note":"When referring to the genus Synura as a whole, use 'has' (singular).

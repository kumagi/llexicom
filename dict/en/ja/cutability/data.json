It's often used when talking about materials in manufacturing or food science. If something has high cutability, it means you can cut it easily. The word is formed by adding '-ability' to 'cut', which means 'capable of being cut'. It's not a word you'd use in everyday conversation, but it's helpful in specific contexts where the ease of cutting is important."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The improved cutability of the new plastic film increased production efficiency.","translation":"新しいプラスチックフィルムの切断可能性が向上したことで、生産効率が向上しました。","type":"general","meaning_category":"ease of cutting"},{"sentence":"The cutability of the meat was tested using a standardized blade.","translation":"その肉の切りやすさは、標準化された刃を使用してテストされました。","type":"technical","meaning_category":"property of material"},{"sentence":"Factors affecting the cutability of bread include moisture content and crumb structure.","translation":"パンの切りやすさに影響を与える要因には、水分量とクラムの構造が含まれます。","type":"food science","meaning_category":"food property"}]}

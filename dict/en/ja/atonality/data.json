Unlike tonal music, which establishes a clear sense of home or resolution, atonal music avoids these conventions, creating a sense of ambiguity and dissonance.

This means that there is no central key or tonic note that the music gravitates towards. Instead, all twelve notes of the chromatic scale are treated as equal, leading to a sense of harmonic ambiguity and dissonance. Understanding atonality requires some familiarity with music theory concepts and the historical context of its development in the early 20th century."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The piece was a study in atonality, with no discernible key.","translation":"その楽曲は無調の研究であり、判別可能なキーはなかった。","type":"general"},{"sentence":"Some listeners find atonality challenging to appreciate.","translation":"無調は鑑賞するのが難しいと感じるリスナーもいる。","type":"general"},{"sentence":"The composer explored atonality in his early works before developing his twelve-tone technique.","translation":"作曲家は十二音技法を発展させる前に、初期の作品で無調を探求した。","type":"historical"}]}

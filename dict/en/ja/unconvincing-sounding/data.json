It is often used when someone is trying to deceive or mislead others, but their attempt is not successful because their words or voice betray their insincerity.","priority":"N/A"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The unconvincing sounding excuse.","correct":"✓ The unconvincing-sounding excuse.","note":"The hyphen is important to connect the two words and create a compound adjective modifying 'excuse'."},{"incorrect":"✗ He was unconvincing sounding.","correct":"✓ He sounded unconvincing. / ✓ His excuse was unconvincing-sounding.","note":"'Unconvincing-sounding' is an adjective that modifies a noun.

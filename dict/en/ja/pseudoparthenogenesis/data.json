It's a form of parthenogenesis (development of an egg without fertilization) where the egg still needs to be activated by sperm, but the sperm's genetic material isn't used to create the offspring. This term is primarily encountered in advanced biology or genetics contexts. It's important to differentiate it from true parthenogenesis, where sperm is not needed at all. Understanding this term requires a solid foundation in reproductive biology.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"Some fish species reproduce via pseudoparthenogenesis, ensuring offspring even when males are scarce.","translation":"一部の魚種は偽単為生殖によって繁殖し、雄が少ない場合でも子孫を確保する。","type":"scientific","meaning_category":"reproduction"},{"sentence":"The mechanism of pseudoparthenogenesis involves sperm activation of the egg, followed by the expulsion or inactivation of the sperm's chromosomes.","translation":"偽単為生殖のメカニズムには、精子による卵の活性化と、それに続く精子の染色体の排出または不活性化が含まれる。","type":"scientific","meaning_category":"mechanism"}]}

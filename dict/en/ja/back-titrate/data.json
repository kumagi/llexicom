Back titration is a technique used when the endpoint of the direct titration is difficult to observe, or when the reaction between the analyte and the titrant is slow. It involves adding a known excess of a standard reagent to the analyte, allowing the reaction to go to completion, and then titrating the excess reagent with another standard solution. This allows for the determination of the amount of the original analyte by calculating how much of the first reagent reacted.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ We should titrate back the solution.","correct":"✓ We should back-titrate the solution.","note":"The correct term is 'back-titrate,' not 'titrate back.'"},{"incorrect":"✗ Back titration is when you titrate directly.","correct":"✓ Back titration is when you titrate the excess reagent after reacting it with the analyte.","note":"Back titration involves titrating the excess reagent, not directly titrating the analyte."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["back titration (noun)"],"phrasal_verbs":[],"priority":"★★★"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Back-titrate' is a specialized term used in chemistry, specifically in the context of analytical techniques.

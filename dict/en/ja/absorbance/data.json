It is related to transmittance (the fraction of incident light that passes through the sample) by the equation A = -log₁₀(T), where A is absorbance and T is transmittance. A higher absorbance value indicates that more light is absorbed by the sample, and less light passes through.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The absorption is high.","correct":"✓ The absorbance is high.","note":"'Absorption' refers to the process, while 'absorbance' is the quantitative measure."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["absorb (verb)","absorbing (adjective)","absorption (noun)"],"related_terms":["spectrophotometer","wavelength","concentration","Beer's law"]},"level_frequency":{"frequency_corpus":"Common in scientific and technical contexts, less common in general conversation.","priority":"★★☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Absorbance' is a technical term primarily used in chemistry, physics, and related scientific fields.

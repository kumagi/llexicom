It describes a condition where muscle fibers, especially in the heart, contract rapidly and irregularly, rather than in a coordinated manner. This can disrupt the normal function of the organ. Because it is a specialized term, it is most often encountered in medical texts, discussions, or when describing a patient's condition. Understanding this word is essential for those in healthcare or those reading medical literature.","priority":"★★★"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The patient's heart was fibrillating, requiring immediate defibrillation.","translation":"患者の心臓が細動していたため、直ちに除細動が必要だった。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"細動する"},{"sentence":"The monitor showed a fibrillating heart rhythm.","translation":"モニターは細動している心臓のリズムを示していた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"細動している"},{"sentence":"Ventricular fibrillation is a life-threatening condition where the ventricles are fibrillating instead of pumping blood.","translation":"心室細動は、心室が血液を送り出す代わりに細動している生命を脅かす状態である。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"細動している"},{"sentence":"The doctor noticed the muscle fibrillating and ordered further tests.","translation":"医師は筋肉が細動していることに気づき、追加の検査を指示した。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"細動する"}]}

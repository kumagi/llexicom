It works by emitting light whose properties change depending on the temperature. This is useful for measuring temperature in situations where you can't physically touch the object, such as in high-temperature environments or in small spaces. It's a technical term used in fields like engineering and physics."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The **thermophosphor** coating allowed for precise temperature mapping of the turbine blade.","translation":"熱蛍光体コーティングにより、タービンブレードの正確な温度マッピングが可能になりました。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"material"},{"sentence":"The intensity of the **thermophosphor** emission decreased with increasing temperature.","translation":"熱蛍光体からの発光強度は、温度の上昇とともに減少しました。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"material property"}]}

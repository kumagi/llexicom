It is a key component in the process of converting light energy into chemical energy, which sustains plant life and, indirectly, most life on Earth. The word is derived from Greek roots, 'chloros' (green) and 'phyllon' (leaf), reflecting its color and location within plants. While not commonly used in everyday conversation, it is a fundamental term in biology, botany, and environmental science.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The high chlorophyll content in the algae indicates a healthy ecosystem.","translation":"藻類のクロロフィル含有量が高いことは、生態系が健全であることを示しています。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"葉緑素"},{"sentence":"Chlorophyll absorbs red and blue light most effectively.","translation":"クロロフィルは赤色光と青色光を最も効果的に吸収します。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"葉緑素"},{"sentence":"Without chlorophyll, plants cannot produce their own food.","translation":"クロロフィルがなければ、植物は自分で食物を生産することができません。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"葉緑素"}]}

It's used to show that someone agrees with something but not completely, or that something is true but with some exceptions. Because it's not a very common word, it's more suitable for advanced English speakers and writers who want to express nuanced opinions or agreements. It's often better to use phrases like 'with some reservations' or 'to a certain extent' instead of 'qualifiedly' to make your writing clearer and more natural."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The scientist qualifiedly supported the new theory, acknowledging its potential but also pointing out its limitations.","translation":"科学者は新しい理論を限定的に支持し、その可能性を認めましたが、その限界も指摘しました。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"limited support"},{"sentence":"The committee qualifiedly approved the proposal, subject to some revisions.","translation":"委員会は、いくつかの修正を条件に、提案を条件付きで承認しました。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"conditional approval"},{"sentence":"He qualifiedly denied the allegations, admitting to some minor errors but denying any wrongdoing.","translation":"彼は申し立てを限定的に否定し、いくつかの小さな誤りを認めましたが、不正行為は否定しました。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"partial denial"}]}

'Imaginary' comes from the Latin word 'imaginarius', meaning 'of or belonging to the imagination', derived from 'imago' meaning 'image'. The mathematical sense arose because these numbers were initially considered 'unreal' or 'imagined' solutions to equations.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/ɪˈmædʒɪˌnɛriz/","syllables":"i-mag-i-nar-ies"},"inflection":{"noun_plural":"imaginaries"},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"The term 'imaginaries' has two main uses.

The key characteristic of an initialism is that each letter is pronounced individually (e.g., 'FBI' is pronounced 'eff-bee-eye'). This distinguishes it from an acronym, where the letters are pronounced as a single word (e.g., 'NATO' is pronounced 'nay-toe'). However, in common usage, the terms 'acronym' and 'initialism' are often used interchangeably.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ NATO is an initialism.","correct":"✓ NATO is an acronym.","note":"NATO is pronounced as a word ('nay-toe'), so it's an acronym, not an initialism."},{"incorrect":"✗ An initialism must be written in lowercase.","correct":"✓ Initialisms are typically written in uppercase.","note":"Initialisms are usually written in uppercase to distinguish them as abbreviations."},{"incorrect":"✗ Initialisms are always proper nouns.","correct":"✓ Initialisms can represent both proper and common nouns.","note":"While many initialisms represent proper nouns (e.g., organizations), some represent common nouns (e.g., DIY - Do It Yourself)."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["initial (adjective, noun, verb)","initialize (verb)"],"related_terms":["acronym","abbreviation","alphabetism"],"priority":"★★★"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C1","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"The word 'initialism' refers to a type of abbreviation formed by using the first letters of a series of words.

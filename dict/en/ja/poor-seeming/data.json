It's a more descriptive way of saying something 'looks poor' or 'seems poor.' Because it's a compound word, it's less frequently used than its simpler alternatives, but it can add nuance to descriptions by emphasizing the appearance or impression of poverty rather than actual poverty. It is more common in written English than spoken. Hyphenation is important when using it before a noun."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The restaurant's poor-seeming decor hid the fact that it served some of the best food in town.","translation":"そのレストランの粗末に見える内装は、町で最高の料理を提供しているという事実を隠していた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"appearance of poverty"},{"sentence":"The actor often played characters who were poor-seeming, despite his own wealth.","translation":"その俳優は、自身の富にもかかわらず、しばしば貧乏に見える役を演じた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"appearance of poverty"},{"sentence":"Her poor-seeming clothes were actually designer items meant to look distressed.","translation":"彼女の粗末に見える服は、実はダメージ加工を施したデザイナーズアイテムだった。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"appearance of poverty"}]}

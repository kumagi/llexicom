It's used to talk about materials that are designed to not burn easily, like those used in airplanes or buildings. The word is formed by adding 'non-' to 'flammability', which means the ability to burn. It's a more advanced term, so you'll usually find it in scientific or technical writing."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The high **non-flammability** of the insulation prevented the fire from spreading quickly.","translation":"断熱材の高い不燃性により、火災の延焼を遅らせることができました。","type":"general","meaning_category":"property"},{"sentence":"The government regulations specify the required **non-flammability** for children's clothing.","translation":"政府の規制では、子供服に必要な不燃性が規定されています。","type":"regulatory","meaning_category":"requirement"},{"sentence":"Engineers consider the **non-flammability** of various materials when designing spacecraft.","translation":"エンジニアは、宇宙船を設計する際に、さまざまな材料の不燃性を考慮します。","type":"technical","meaning_category":"consideration"}]}

It describes the act of reversing a previous acquittal, which is the finding of a defendant not guilty in a criminal trial. This typically occurs when new evidence emerges that strongly suggests the defendant's guilt, or when there is a legal error that necessitates a retrial. The concept is controversial and subject to legal limitations in many jurisdictions due to principles like double jeopardy.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The judge decided to unacquit the witness.","correct":"✓ The judge decided to recall the witness.","note":"'Unacquit' applies to the defendant, not a witness.

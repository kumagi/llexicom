It differs from a great circle (orthodrome), which is the shortest distance between two points on a sphere but requires constantly changing direction. Loxodromes appear as straight lines on a Mercator projection map, making them useful for navigation.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The loxodromic is the shortest path.","correct":"✓ The orthodromic (great circle) is the shortest path.","note":"The loxodromic is not the shortest path, the orthodromic is."}],"priority":"★☆☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["loxodrome (noun)"],"related_terms":["rhumb line","Mercator projection","great circle","orthodrome"],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Very low frequency","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C2","text":"The term 'loxodromic' is a specialized term primarily used in the fields of navigation, cartography, and mathematics.

It posits that our knowledge of the external world is based solely on our experiences or sensations (phenomena). A core tenet is that statements about physical objects can be reduced to statements about possible sensory experiences. While influential, phenomenalism faces challenges, particularly in providing a complete and coherent account of how such reductions can be achieved.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Phenomenalism believes that physical objects are real and independent of our minds.","correct":"✓ Phenomenalism believes that physical objects are constructions of our experiences.","note":"Phenomenalism does not assert the independent reality of physical objects.

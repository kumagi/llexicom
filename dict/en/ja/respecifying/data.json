'Specify' originates from the Latin word 'species' (meaning 'kind' or 'sort') and 'facere' (meaning 'to make'). Thus, 'specifying' means 'to make specific' or 'to define precisely'. Therefore, 'respecifying' means to make specific again or to redefine.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/ˌriːˈspesɪfaɪɪŋ/","syllables":"re-spec-i-fy-ing"},"inflection":{"verb_forms":{"present_simple":["respecifies"],"past_simple":"respecified","past_participle":"respecified","present_participle":"respecifying"}},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Respecifying' is used when something has already been specified or defined, but there is a need to make the specifications more precise, accurate, or updated.

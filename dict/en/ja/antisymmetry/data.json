A binary relation R on a set A is antisymmetric if, for all a and b in A, if aRb and bRa, then a = b. In simpler terms, if a is related to b, and b is related to a, then a and b must be the same element.

If element 'a' is related to element 'b', and element 'b' is related to element 'a', then for the relationship to be antisymmetric, 'a' and 'b' must be the same. This concept is important in understanding orderings and structures in mathematics and computer science. It's a more advanced concept, typically encountered in higher-level studies.

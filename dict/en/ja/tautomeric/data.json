It describes the properties or characteristics of molecules that exhibit tautomerism, which is the ability to exist in multiple forms that readily interconvert through the migration of a hydrogen atom and the relocation of a double bond. This term is typically encountered in advanced chemistry contexts."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The keto and enol forms are **tautomeric** isomers.","translation":"ケト型とエノール型は互変異性体である。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"互変異性の"},{"sentence":"Understanding the **tautomeric** behavior of this compound is crucial for drug design.","translation":"この化合物の互変異性挙動を理解することは、医薬品設計にとって重要である。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"互変異性の"}]}

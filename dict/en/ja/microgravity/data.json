It's often used interchangeably with \"weightlessness\" or \"zero gravity,\" although these terms aren't technically accurate. In a true zero-gravity environment, there would be no gravitational forces at all. In microgravity, there are still some gravitational forces present, but they are so weak that objects appear to float. This condition is typically experienced in orbiting spacecraft, where the spacecraft and its contents are in a constant state of freefall around the Earth.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Micro-gravity is the same as zero gravity.","correct":"✓ Microgravity is not exactly the same as zero gravity, but the terms are often used interchangeably.","note":"Microgravity is a state of near weightlessness, not a complete absence of gravity.

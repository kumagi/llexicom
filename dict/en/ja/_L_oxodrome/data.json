It refers to a path on a sphere that crosses all meridians at the same angle, resulting in a constant compass bearing. This concept is important for understanding how courses are plotted on maps, particularly Mercator projections where loxodromes appear as straight lines. While not commonly used in everyday language, it is essential for professionals in fields such as maritime navigation and aviation."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The ship followed a loxodrome to reach its destination.","translation":"船は目的地に到達するために等角航路を辿った。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"航海"},{"sentence":"The loxodromic line made navigation simpler.","translation":"等角航路は航海をより簡単にした。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"航海"}]}

Because it's less common than words like \"different\" or \"various,\" it's more likely to appear in advanced texts or formal writing. To understand it, remember that it comes from the verb \"to vary,\" which means \"to change\" or \"to be different.\" So, \"varyingly\" describes how something is done in a changing or different manner."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The flowers in the garden bloomed varyingly, some earlier than others.","translation":"庭の花は様々に咲き、早く咲くものもあれば遅く咲くものもあった。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"様々に"},{"sentence":"The reviewers responded varyingly to the film, with some praising it and others criticizing it.","translation":"評論家たちはその映画に対して様々に反応し、賞賛する人もいれば批判する人もいた。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"異なって"},{"sentence":"The levels of pollution affected the local ecosystem varyingly.","translation":"汚染のレベルは、地元の生態系に様々な影響を与えた。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"変化して"}]}

It means that a signal (like sound or an image) wasn't sampled correctly when it was converted into digital data. This can happen if the sampling rate (how often the signal is measured) is too low, which can cause distortion or loss of information. Understanding this term requires knowledge of digital signal processing concepts."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The engineer determined that the audio was missampled, resulting in a loss of high-frequency content.","translation":"エンジニアは、音声が誤ってサンプリングされた結果、高周波成分が失われたと判断した。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"誤ってサンプリングする"},{"sentence":"The missampled image showed noticeable aliasing artifacts.","translation":"誤ってサンプリングされた画像には、顕著なエイリアシングアーチファクトが見られた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"誤ってサンプリングされた"}]}

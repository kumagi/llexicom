It is formed by adding the prefix 'un-' (not) and the suffix '-able' (capable of) to the word 'escheat'. 'Escheat' refers to the reversion of property to the state (or a feudal lord in historical contexts) when a person dies without a will and has no legal heirs. Therefore, 'unescheatable' means that a particular piece of property is not subject to this process of reversion to the state, typically due to specific conditions or restrictions placed upon its ownership. This term is primarily encountered in legal documents and discussions related to property law."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The lawyer argued that the land was specifically designated as unescheatable in the original deed.","translation":"弁護士は、その土地は元の証書で特にエシュートの対象とならないと指定されていると主張した。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"law"}]}

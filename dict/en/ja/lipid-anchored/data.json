This is a post-translational modification. The lipid anchor can be a variety of lipid types, such as fatty acids (e.g., palmitate, myristate), isoprenoids (e.g., farnesyl, geranylgeranyl), or glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI).","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"The protein is lipid anchored to the cytoplasm.","correct":"The protein is lipid-anchored to the cell membrane.","note":"Lipid anchors insert into the cell membrane, not the cytoplasm."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["lipid anchor","palmitoylation","myristoylation","prenylation","GPI anchor","GPI-anchored"],"phrasal_verbs":[],"priority":"★★★"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Lipid-anchored' is a technical term used in biochemistry and cell biology to describe proteins that are attached to a cell membrane through a lipid molecule.

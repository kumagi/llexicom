It can also describe something lacking energy or vigor, such as a 'spanaemic economy.' Because 'anaemic' is the more standard spelling, it is more frequently encountered and generally preferred. If you mean to describe a lack of energy or a pale appearance due to a medical condition, 'anaemic' is the safer choice.

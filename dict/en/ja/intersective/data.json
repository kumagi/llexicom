For example, if something is a 'red book', it must be both 'red' and a 'book'. This contrasts with subsective adjectives (like 'alleged thief', where an 'alleged thief' is not necessarily a thief) and privative adjectives (like 'fake diamond', where a 'fake diamond' is not a diamond).","priority":"☆☆☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"The adjective 'possible' is intersective.","correct":"The adjective 'possible' is not intersective.","note":"'Possible' is not intersective because a 'possible solution' is not necessarily a solution."}],"priority":"☆☆☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["intersection","intersect","intersectivity"],"phrasal_verbs":[]},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"N/A","frequency_google_ngram":"Very low frequency - Primarily used in academic linguistics.","priority":"☆☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C2","text":"The term 'intersective' is a technical term used in linguistics, specifically in semantics and the study of noun phrases.

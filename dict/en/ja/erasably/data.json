It's used to describe how something is written or applied, emphasizing that it can be easily removed. For example, if you use a whiteboard marker, you can write 'erasably' on the whiteboard, meaning you can easily wipe it off later. It's not a very common word, but it's useful when you want to highlight the removable quality of something. Remember that it describes *how* something is done, not the thing itself (that would be 'erasable')."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The pencil sketched erasably on the canvas.","translation":"鉛筆はキャンバスに消せるようにスケッチしました。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"manner"},{"sentence":"The data was stored erasably on the magnetic tape.","translation":"データは磁気テープに消去可能に保存されました。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"manner"},{"sentence":"The instructions were written erasably in case of changes.","translation":"指示は変更があった場合に備えて、消せるように書かれていました。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"manner"}]}

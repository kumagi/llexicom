It narrows down search results to only those pages whose HTML title contains the specified keyword(s). This is useful for finding pages that are specifically about a particular topic, as the title is often a good indicator of the page's main subject. The `allintitle:` operator is similar, but requires *all* specified keywords to be present in the title.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ intitle recipe chocolate cake","correct":"✓ intitle:recipe chocolate cake","note":"There should be no space between `intitle:` and the keyword."},{"incorrect":"✗ intitle: recipe chocolate cake","correct":"✓ intitle:recipe chocolate cake","note":"There should be no space after the colon."},{"incorrect":"✗ Use intitle to find all words in the title.","correct":"✓ Use allintitle: to find all words in the title.","note":"Use `allintitle:` to require all keywords to be in the title."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":[],"phrasal_verbs":[],"related_operators":["inurl:","site:","filetype:","intext:","allinurl:","allintext:","allintitle:"],"priority":"★★★"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"N/A","frequency_google_ngram":"N/A","priority":"N/A"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"N/A","text":"`intitle:` is a special command you can use in search engines to find web pages where the words you type after `intitle:` appear in the title of the page.

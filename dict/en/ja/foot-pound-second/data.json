This system is primarily used in the United States, especially in certain engineering fields. Understanding this term is important when dealing with older engineering documents or when working in industries that have not fully converted to the metric system. It is essential to recognize that the FPS system is distinct from the more widely used metric system (SI units)."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"Many older engineering textbooks use the foot-pound-second system for calculations.","translation":"多くの古い工学教科書では、計算にフィート・ポンド・秒単位系が使用されています。","type":"general"},{"sentence":"The British Thermal Unit (BTU) is derived from the foot-pound-second system.","translation":"英国熱量単位（BTU）は、フィート・ポンド・秒単位系から派生しています。","type":"technical"}]}

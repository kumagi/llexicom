It's commonly used in scientific and industrial contexts, such as chemistry, physics, and engineering. The term describes the phase transition that occurs when a substance gains enough energy to overcome intermolecular forces, resulting in a change of state to a gas or vapor. Understanding the term requires a background in science or engineering. The plural form, 'vaporizations,' is used when discussing multiple instances or types of vaporization processes."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The experiment involved the controlled vaporizations of various organic compounds.","translation":"その実験では、様々な有機化合物の制御された気化が含まれていた。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"気化"},{"sentence":"Different methods were used to study the vaporizations of the metal alloys.","translation":"金属合金の気化を研究するために、様々な方法が用いられた。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"気化"}]}

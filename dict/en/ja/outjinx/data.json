The word is formed by combining 'out-' (meaning to surpass) with 'jinx'. It implies a playful competition to negate bad luck by being the first to acknowledge a potentially jinxed situation. Due to its informal and somewhat niche usage, it is more likely to be understood by native English speakers familiar with superstition.

If a rock is described as 'schistoid,' it means that it has a texture similar to that of schist, which is a type of metamorphic rock characterized by its layered or foliated structure. This texture arises from the parallel alignment of minerals within the rock. The term is used when the rock doesn't fully meet the criteria to be called a schist, but it shows a similar structural characteristic. It's a specialized word, so you'll mostly encounter it in geological contexts."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The geologist examined the sample and noted its schistoid nature.","translation":"地質学者はサンプルを調べ、その片理状の性質を指摘した。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"片状構造に似た"},{"sentence":"The outcrop displayed a weakly developed schistoid texture.","translation":"その露頭は、弱く発達した片状構造を示していた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"片状構造に似た"}]}

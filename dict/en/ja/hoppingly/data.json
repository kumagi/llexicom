It suggests a sense of enthusiasm and high spirits. Because it is not frequently used, it is more likely to be encountered in advanced texts or creative writing where the author seeks to add vividness and expressiveness. It is formed by adding the suffix \"-ly\" to the word \"hopping,\" which is derived from the verb \"hop.\" Understanding its meaning requires a good vocabulary and an appreciation for nuanced descriptions."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The children ran hoppingly towards the ice cream truck.","translation":"子供たちはアイスクリームのトラックに向かって楽しそうに跳ねながら走った。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"活発に"},{"sentence":"The puppy greeted its owner hoppingly, wagging its tail.","translation":"子犬はしっぽを振りながら、飼い主を元気いっぱいに跳ねて迎えた。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"元気に"},{"sentence":"She danced hoppingly across the stage, radiating joy.","translation":"彼女は喜びを放ちながら、舞台を跳ね回るように踊った。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"楽しそうに"}]}

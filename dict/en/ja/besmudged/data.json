'Besmudge' is formed by adding the prefix 'be-' to the word 'smudge'. 'Smudge' itself comes from the Middle English word 'smudgen', meaning to smear or stain. The prefix 'be-' in this context means 'to cover with' or 'to affect with'. Therefore, 'besmudge' means to cover something with smudges, and 'besmudged' means that something has been covered with smudges.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/bɪˈsmʌdʒd/","syllables":"bi-smudged"},"inflection":{"verb_forms":{"present_simple":["besmudge","besmudges"],"past_simple":"besmudged","past_participle":"besmudged","present_participle":"besmudging"}},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Besmudged' is a relatively uncommon word that describes something covered in smudges, which are dirty marks or smears.

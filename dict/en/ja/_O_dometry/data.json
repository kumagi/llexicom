It relies on data from motion sensors such as wheel encoders, inertial measurement units (IMUs), or visual sensors. Wheel odometry, for example, uses the rotation of wheels to estimate distance traveled. However, odometry is prone to errors due to wheel slippage, uneven surfaces, and sensor inaccuracies. These errors accumulate over time, leading to drift in the estimated position. Therefore, odometry is often combined with other localization techniques, such as GPS or SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping), to improve accuracy.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The odometry was very precise.","correct":"✓ The odometry data was very precise.","note":"'Odometry' refers to the system or technique, so it's more appropriate to refer to 'odometry data' when discussing the data itself."},{"incorrect":"✗ Odometry is always accurate.","correct":"✓ Odometry is prone to errors and drift.","note":"Odometry is susceptible to errors due to wheel slippage and other factors, so it's not always accurate."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["odometer (noun: a device for measuring the distance traveled by a vehicle)"],"phrasal_verbs":[],"related_concepts":["SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)","INS (Inertial Navigation System)","GPS (Global Positioning System)","Sensor fusion","Localization","Navigation"],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"B2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low","priority":"★★☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Odometry' is a technical term related to robotics and navigation.

'Edge' comes from Old English 'ecg', meaning 'corner, border, sword'. The '-ing' suffix indicates a continuous or gradual action, and '-ly' transforms it into an adverb. Thus, 'edgingly' describes an action performed cautiously, gradually, or towards the edge.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/ˈɛdʒɪŋli/","syllables":"edg-ing-ly"},"inflection":{"notes":"Adverbs do not typically inflect."},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Edgingly' is used to describe actions that are performed with caution, often involving gradual movement, or a sense of being near a boundary or edge.

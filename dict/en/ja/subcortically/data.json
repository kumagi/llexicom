It is commonly used in neuroscience, neurology, and related fields to specify the involvement of brain regions such as the basal ganglia, thalamus, amygdala, and hippocampus. These areas are crucial for functions like motor control, sensory relay, emotional processing, and memory formation. The term helps distinguish between functions primarily driven by the cortex (e.g., conscious thought, language) and those more reliant on deeper brain structures (e.g., reflexes, basic emotions).","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The information is processed subcortical.","correct":"✓ The information is processed subcortically.","note":"The adverbial form \"subcortically\" should be used to modify the verb \"processed,\" not the adjective form \"subcortical.\""},{"incorrect":"✗ Subcortexly located structures...","correct":"✓ Subcortically located structures...","note":"Use the adverb \"subcortically\" to modify the adjective \"located.\""}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["subcortex (noun): The region of the brain beneath the cerebral cortex.","cortical (adjective): Relating to the cerebral cortex.","cortex (noun): The outer layer of the brain or other organ."],"related_terms":["basal ganglia","thalamus","amygdala","hippocampus","brainstem"],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency.

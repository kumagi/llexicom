It's a way to explore a graph or tree by looking at all the nodes close to the starting point before moving further away. Imagine you're searching a maze; BFS means checking every path right next to you before trying longer routes. Computer scientists use it to solve problems like finding the shortest way between two points on a map or analyzing networks.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The **BFS** algorithm visits all neighbors before moving to the next level.","translation":"BFSアルゴリズムは、次のレベルに移る前にすべての隣接ノードを訪問します。","type":"definition","meaning_category":"幅優先探索"},{"sentence":"We used **BFS** to find the minimum number of steps to reach the target node.","translation":"ターゲットノードに到達するための最小ステップ数を見つけるためにBFSを使用しました。","type":"example","meaning_category":"幅優先探索"}]}

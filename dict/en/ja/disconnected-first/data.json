This is particularly useful for mobile apps or web applications used in areas with poor or intermittent internet connectivity. Data is stored locally and synchronized with a server when a connection is available. This contrasts with traditional online-only applications that require a constant internet connection to function.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ We are using a disconnect first approach.","correct":"✓ We are using a disconnected-first approach.","note":"The correct term is \"disconnected-first,\" not \"disconnect first.\""},{"incorrect":"✗ Disconnected first is only for mobile apps.","correct":"✓ While commonly used in mobile apps, disconnected-first architectures can also be applied to desktop or web applications.","note":"While often associated with mobile apps, the disconnected-first principle can be applied to various types of applications."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":[],"phrasal_verbs":[],"related_concepts":["offline synchronization","local storage","data replication","conflict resolution","progressive web app (PWA)","service worker"]},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C1","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency - relatively new and specialized term.","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"\"Disconnected-first\" is a technical term used in software development, particularly when discussing application architecture.

They contain carotenoid pigments, which give these plant parts their yellow, orange, and red hues. They are a type of plastid, related to chloroplasts (which contain chlorophyll and are involved in photosynthesis) and leucoplasts (which are colorless and store starch, lipids, or proteins). In some cases, chloroplasts can transform into chromoplastids during the ripening process, as seen in tomatoes.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Chromoplasts are responsible for photosynthesis.","correct":"✓ Chloroplasts are responsible for photosynthesis.","note":"Chromoplasts are responsible for color, while chloroplasts are responsible for photosynthesis."},{"incorrect":"✗ Chromoplastids are found in animal cells.","correct":"✓ Chromoplastids are found in plant cells.","note":"Chromoplastids are organelles specific to plant cells."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["chromoplast (alternative spelling)","carotenoid","plastid","chloroplast","leucoplast"],"phrasal_verbs":[],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency - specialized scientific term.","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Chromoplastid' is a scientific term referring to a type of organelle found in plant cells.

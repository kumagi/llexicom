A lining is an extra layer of fabric that is sewn into the inside of a garment to provide structure, comfort, and protection. A semilined garment has a lining that only covers part of the inside, usually the upper back and shoulders. This makes the garment lighter and more breathable than a fully lined garment, but it still provides some structure and comfort.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The semilined is better than unlined.","correct":"✓ A semilined jacket is better than an unlined jacket.","note":"\"Semilined\" is an adjective, so it needs to modify a noun."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["semi- (prefix meaning \"partially\" or \"half\")","lined (adjective meaning \"having a lining\")"],"phrasal_verbs":[]},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"N/A","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"B2","text":"The word \"semilined\" is a technical term used in the clothing industry to describe garments that have a partial lining.

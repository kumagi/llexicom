It describes the situation where an individual has two different versions (alleles) of a gene at a particular location (locus) on their chromosomes. In population genetics, it also refers to the proportion of individuals in a population that have different alleles at a specific location. High heterozygosity generally indicates greater genetic diversity within a population, which can be important for its ability to adapt to changing environments. Understanding this term requires a basic knowledge of genetics concepts like genes, alleles, and chromosomes."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The study examined the relationship between heterozygosity and disease resistance.","translation":"その研究では、ヘテロ接合性と病気抵抗性の関係が調べられた。","type":"general","meaning_category":"genetic study"},{"sentence":"Maintaining high levels of heterozygosity is crucial for the conservation of endangered species.","translation":"高いレベルのヘテロ接合性を維持することは、絶滅危惧種の保全にとって重要である。","type":"conservation","meaning_category":"species conservation"},{"sentence":"Researchers used microsatellite markers to assess heterozygosity in the fish population.","translation":"研究者らは、魚の個体群におけるヘテロ接合性を評価するために、マイクロサテライトマーカーを使用した。","type":"research","meaning_category":"genetic research"}]}

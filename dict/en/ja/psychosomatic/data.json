It doesn’t mean the pain isn't *real*; the physical sensations are genuinely experienced. However, they originate in the mind rather than from a detectable physical illness or injury.  For example, tension headaches, stomach problems, and high blood pressure can sometimes be psychosomatic. Understanding the connection between mind and body is crucial for managing these conditions, often involving therapies like cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) alongside medical treatment."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"Her chronic fatigue was determined to be **psychosomatic** in origin after extensive testing revealed no underlying physical cause.","translation":"彼女の慢性疲労は、徹底的な検査で基礎となる身体的原因が見つからなかったため、心身相関的であると判断された。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"origin/cause of illness"},{"sentence":"Stress can manifest as **psychosomatic** symptoms like stomach aches and muscle tension.","translation":"ストレスは、胃痛や筋肉の緊張など、心身相関的な症状として現れることがある。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"symptoms caused by mental factors"},{"sentence":"The doctor suggested exploring the **psychosomatic** aspects of his pain, given the lack of physical abnormalities.","translation":"医師は、身体的な異常がないことを踏まえ、彼の痛みの心身相関的な側面を探ることを提案した。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"related to mental and physical connection"},{"sentence":"Many patients benefit from therapy that addresses the **psychosomatic** component of their illness.","translation":"多くの患者は、病気における心身相関的な要素に対処するセラピーから恩恵を受けている。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"related to mental aspect of illness"}]}

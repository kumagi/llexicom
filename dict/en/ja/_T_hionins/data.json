They are typically 45-47 amino acids long and contain three or four disulfide bridges, which are essential for their structure and function. Thionins exhibit a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity against bacteria, fungi, and even some viruses. They are believed to play a role in plant defense against pathogens.","priority":"★☆☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[],"priority":"★★★"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["prothionin (前チオニン)"],"phrasal_verbs":[]},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"非常に低頻度","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C2","text":"Thionins are specialized antimicrobial proteins found in plants.

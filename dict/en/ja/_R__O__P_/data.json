It involves chaining together small sequences of machine instructions (gadgets) that already exist in the program's memory or loaded libraries. By carefully crafting the call stack, an attacker can control the order in which these gadgets are executed, effectively creating a new program with the existing code.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{},"related_words":{"derivatives":["gadget","exploit","DEP","ASLR"],"phrasal_verbs":[]},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"N/A","frequency_google_ngram":"Low","priority":"☆☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C2","text":"ROP is a complex computer security concept used to bypass security measures.

This structure is different from monocrystalline materials, which are composed of a single, continuous crystal lattice. Multicrystalline materials are often used in applications where cost is a primary concern, as they are generally less expensive to produce than monocrystalline materials.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{},"related_words":{"derivatives":["multicrystallinity"],"related_terms":["monocrystalline","amorphous","crystalline"]},"level_frequency":{},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"The term 'multicrystalline' is a technical term primarily used in materials science and engineering.

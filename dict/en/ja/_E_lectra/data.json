She is the daughter of Agamemnon and Clytemnestra, known for her relentless desire for revenge against her mother for killing her father.  The story of Electra has been dramatized by ancient playwrights like Sophocles, Euripides, and Aeschylus, and later adapted by modern authors such as Eugene O'Neill and Jean-Paul Sartre. The \"Electra complex\" is a psychoanalytic concept developed by Sigmund Freud, describing a girl’s unconscious sexual desire for her father and feelings of jealousy towards her mother.  Understanding the word often requires familiarity with Greek literature, mythology or psychology."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"Sophocles' play **Electra** explores themes of revenge and justice.","translation":"ソポクレスの戯曲『エレクトラ』は復讐と正義というテーマを探求している。","type":"noun (title of a play)","meaning_category":"劇名"},{"sentence":"The character of **Electra** is often seen as a symbol of female rage.","translation":"エレクトラのキャラクターはしばしば女性の怒りの象徴と見なされる。","type":"noun (character)","meaning_category":"登場人物"},{"sentence":"Freud used the myth of **Electra** to develop his theory of psychosexual development.","translation":"フロイトはエレクトラの神話を彼の精神性発達理論を構築するために用いた。","type":"noun (mythological figure)","meaning_category":"神話の登場人物"},{"sentence":"She identified a strong **Electra** complex in the patient's early childhood.","translation":"彼女は患者の幼少期に強いエレクトラ・コンプレックスを特定した。","type":"noun (psychology)","meaning_category":"心理学用語"}]}

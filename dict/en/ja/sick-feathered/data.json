It can be used literally to describe the physical condition of a bird's feathers, indicating disease or malnutrition. More often, it's used metaphorically to describe something (like a company, organization, or even a person) that is in a weakened or declining state. The image evoked is one of something once vibrant and healthy now appearing dull, damaged, and struggling.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The sick-feathered idea never took flight.","correct":"✓ The ill-conceived idea never took flight.","note":"While \"sick-feathered\" can be used metaphorically, \"ill-conceived\" is a more common and natural way to describe a poorly planned idea."}],"priority":"★☆☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["sick (adjective)","feathered (adjective)"],"phrases":["under the weather (idiom for feeling unwell)"],"priority":"★☆☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"N/A (uncommon)","frequency_google_ngram":"Very low frequency","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"The term \"sick-feathered\" is not commonly used and may not be immediately understood by all English speakers.

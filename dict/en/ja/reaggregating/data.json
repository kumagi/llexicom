'Aggregate' originates from the Latin word 'aggregatus,' the past participle of 'aggregare,' meaning 'to add to a flock or to collect into a flock.' This Latin term is composed of 'ad-' (to, toward) and 'grex' (flock). Therefore, 'reaggregating' essentially means to gather or bring together again.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/ˌriːˈæɡrɪɡeɪtɪŋ/","syllables":"re-ag-gre-ga-ting"},"inflection":{"verb_forms":{"present_simple":["reaggregate","reaggregates"],"past_simple":"reaggregated","past_participle":"reaggregated","present_participle":"reaggregating"}},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Reaggregating' is the present participle and gerund form of the verb 'reaggregate.'

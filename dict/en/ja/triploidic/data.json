This condition often results in sterility, especially in animals, due to problems during meiosis. In plants, triploidy can sometimes lead to larger size or other desirable traits, and can be propagated asexually.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The triploidic is sterile.","correct":"✓ The triploidic organism is sterile. / ✓ Triploidic organisms are often sterile.","note":"'Triploidic' is an adjective, so it needs to modify a noun (e.g., 'organism', 'cell').

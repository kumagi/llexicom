It is a polymorph of silicon dioxide (SiO₂), meaning it has the same chemical composition as quartz but a different crystal structure. Its presence is often used as an indicator of past impact events or high-pressure geological processes.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[],"priority":"☆☆☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["coesite (singular form)"],"phrasal_verbs":[],"priority":"☆☆☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Very low frequency","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C2","text":"Coesites is a technical term in geology and mineralogy, referring to a specific high-pressure form of silicon dioxide.

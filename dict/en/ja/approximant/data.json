This distinguishes them from fricatives (which have audible friction) and plosives (which involve a complete closure). In mathematics, 'approximant' can refer to a value or solution that is close to the true value, but not exact.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Approximants are obstruents.","correct":"✓ Approximants are not obstruents.","note":"Approximants are a distinct class of sounds from obstruents, which include stops, fricatives, and affricates."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["approximate (verb, adjective)","approximation (noun)"],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"The term 'approximant' has specific technical meanings in both phonetics and mathematics.

It refers to the techniques used to create the illusion that sounds are coming from specific locations in space, even when they are being reproduced through headphones or speakers. This is achieved by manipulating various aspects of the sound signal, such as volume, delay, and equalization, to simulate how sound waves interact with the listener's head and ears in a real-world environment.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The spatialization was very good in the painting.","correct":"✓ The perspective was very good in the painting.","note":"'Spatialization' refers to creating auditory space, not visual space.

It describes the process of creating a sense of auditory space by manipulating sound signals. This involves techniques that simulate how sound waves interact with the listener's head and ears, allowing the listener to perceive the location and movement of sound sources in a three-dimensional environment. The term is not typically used in everyday conversation and is more common in academic or professional discussions related to audio technology. Understanding this term requires familiarity with concepts in acoustics and signal processing."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The concert hall's acoustics were designed to enhance the spatialization of the music.","translation":"そのコンサートホールの音響は、音楽の空間化を強化するように設計されました。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"音響空間化"},{"sentence":"Advanced spatialization algorithms can create a highly realistic auditory experience.","translation":"高度な空間化アルゴリズムは、非常にリアルな聴覚体験を生み出すことができます。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"音響空間化"},{"sentence":"The researchers used spatialization to study how people perceive sound direction.","translation":"研究者たちは、空間化を使用して、人々が音の方向をどのように認識するかを研究しました。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"音響空間化"}]}

When a raster image is scaled up, it can become pixelated or blurry because the number of pixels remains the same. This is in contrast to vector-based images, which are defined by mathematical equations and can be scaled infinitely without losing quality.","priority":"☆☆☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The image is vector, not raster-based.","correct":"✓ The image is vector-based, not raster-based."},{"incorrect":"✗ Raster based images are always better quality.","correct":"✓ Vector-based images are often better quality for logos and illustrations, while raster-based images are better for photographs."}],"priority":"☆☆☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["rasterize (verb)","rasterization (noun)"],"related_terms":["bitmap","pixel","vector-based","image resolution"]},"level_frequency":{"notes":"Technical term, not common in everyday conversation.","priority":"☆☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Raster-based' is a technical term used in computer graphics to describe images made up of pixels.

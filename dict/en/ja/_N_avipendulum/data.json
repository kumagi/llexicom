Its meaning is derived from its constituent parts: 'navi-' relating to navigation, and 'pendulum,' a swinging weight. Therefore, it likely refers to a fictional device that uses a pendulum for navigational purposes. Understanding this word requires familiarity with the concepts of navigation and pendulums and the ability to infer meaning from word parts. Because it is not a real word, readability is less about recognizing it and more about understanding its construction."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The ancient map indicated the location of the treasure, but only the Navipendulum could guide them through the treacherous maze.","translation":"古代の地図は宝の場所を示していたが、危険な迷路を彼らを導くことができるのはNavipendulumだけだった。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"fictional device"}]}

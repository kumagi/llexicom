It is often used in the context of program evaluation, policy analysis, and research methodology.

Low evaluatability, on the other hand, suggests that the object of evaluation is poorly defined, lacks clear goals, or has outcomes that are difficult to measure.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The evaluateability of the project was good.","correct":"✓ The evaluatability of the project was good.","note":"Correct spelling is crucial.

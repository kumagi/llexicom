It is considered a malignant tumor, meaning it is cancerous and can spread to other parts of the body. There are several subtypes of liposarcoma, each with different characteristics and prognoses.

Treatment options may include surgery to remove the tumor, radiation therapy to kill cancer cells, and chemotherapy to destroy cancer cells throughout the body.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ liposarcoma are a dangerous cancer.","correct":"✓ liposarcoma is a dangerous cancer.","note":"Liposarcoma is a singular noun, so it takes a singular verb."},{"incorrect":"✗ liposarkoma","correct":"✓ liposarcoma","note":"Correct spelling is crucial in medical terms."}],"priority":"★☆☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["lipoma (良性脂肪腫)","sarcoma (肉腫)","oncology (腫瘍学)","chemotherapy (化学療法)","radiotherapy (放射線療法)"],"medical_specialties":["oncology","surgical oncology","radiation oncology","pathology"],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2 (専門用語)","frequency_google_ngram":"非常に低頻度 (Very low frequency)","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Liposarcoma' is a medical term referring to a type of cancer that arises from fat cells.

It's mainly used in fields like astronomy to study magnetic fields of stars and in chemistry to analyze molecular structures. Understanding this term requires some background in physics and optics because it deals with the properties of light and how it interacts with matter. This is a technical term, so it's not commonly used outside of scientific contexts."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The astronomer used a spectropolarimeter to measure the magnetic field of the sun.","translation":"天文学者は、太陽の磁場を測定するために分光偏光計を使用した。","type":"general","meaning_category":"measurement of polarization"},{"sentence":"Spectropolarimeter data helped identify the chiral properties of the new compound.","translation":"分光偏光計のデータは、新しい化合物のキラル特性を特定するのに役立った。","type":"chemistry","meaning_category":"chemical analysis"}]}

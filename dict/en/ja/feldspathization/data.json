It involves the introduction of feldspar components (such as sodium, potassium, or calcium) into a rock, leading to the formation or enrichment of feldspar minerals. This process can significantly change the rock's mineralogical composition and texture.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[],"priority":"☆☆☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["feldspar","feldspathic"],"phrasal_verbs":[]},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":null,"frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency","priority":"☆☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C2","text":"'Feldspathization' is a technical term used in geology to describe a specific type of rock alteration.

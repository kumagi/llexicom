It is formed by adding the prefix 're-' to 'surprise'. You might use it when someone is already familiar with something, but something new or unexpected happens that surprises them again. For example, if you watch a movie a second time and notice a detail you didn't see before, the movie might 'resurprise' you. Because it's not a common word, it's important to use it in contexts where the meaning is clear."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The plot twist resurprised viewers who thought they knew what was coming.","translation":"筋書きのどんでん返しは、何が起こるか知っていると思っていた視聴者を再び驚かせた。","type":"verb (vt)","meaning_category":"再び驚かせる"},{"sentence":"Even after all these years, the beauty of the landscape resurprised her.","translation":"長年経った今でも、その風景の美しさは彼女を改めて驚かせた。","type":"verb (vt)","meaning_category":"改めて驚かせる"}]}

It refers to the state where a person's blood serum does not contain detectable levels of antibodies against a specific antigen. This term is typically encountered in medical literature, research papers, and clinical settings when discussing diagnostic test results and disease progression. It is important to note that seronegativity does not always equate to the absence of disease, as there may be instances where antibodies are not yet detectable or are present at levels below the detection threshold of the test."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The patient's seronegativity made diagnosis challenging despite clear clinical symptoms.","translation":"患者の血清反応陰性により、明らかな臨床症状があるにもかかわらず、診断が困難になりました。","type":"general","meaning_category":"general"},{"sentence":"Researchers are studying factors that contribute to persistent seronegativity in certain infections.","translation":"研究者たちは、特定の感染症における持続的な血清反応陰性に寄与する要因を研究しています。","type":"research","meaning_category":"research"},{"sentence":"Seronegativity during the early stages of Lyme disease can complicate testing protocols.","translation":"ライム病の初期段階における血清反応陰性は、検査プロトコルを複雑にする可能性があります。","type":"medical","meaning_category":"medical"}]}

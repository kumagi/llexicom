It is typically used in scientific or technical contexts, and understanding it requires a good grasp of the concept of symmetry itself. The word is formed by adding the prefix \"non-\" to \"symmetry,\" indicating a negation or lack of symmetry. Therefore, it is not commonly used in everyday language and is more appropriate for advanced English speakers or those in specialized fields."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The architectural design intentionally incorporates nonsymmetry to create a unique visual effect.","translation":"その建築デザインは、意図的に非対称性を取り入れることで、独特の視覚効果を生み出している。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"lack of symmetry"},{"sentence":"The nonsymmetry in the distribution of data points suggests a biased sampling method.","translation":"データ点の分布における非対称性は、偏ったサンプリング方法を示唆している。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"imbalance"},{"sentence":"Researchers are studying the nonsymmetry of certain molecules to understand their behavior.","translation":"研究者たちは、特定の分子の非対称性を研究して、その挙動を理解しようとしている。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"lack of symmetry"}]}

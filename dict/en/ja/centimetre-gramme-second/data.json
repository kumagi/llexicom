It has largely been replaced by the International System of Units (SI), which uses meters, kilograms, and seconds as base units. However, CGS units are still used in some fields of physics and chemistry, particularly in theoretical work. There are several variations of the CGS system, including Gaussian, electrostatic (ESU), and electromagnetic (EMU) units.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ I used CGS unit for the length.","correct":"✓ I used a CGS unit for the length.","note":"'CGS' is an acronym for the system, so when referring to a single unit within the system, use 'a CGS unit'."},{"incorrect":"✗ The SI system is more popular than CGS.","correct":"✓ The SI system is more popular than the CGS system.","note":"While understandable, it's clearer to specify 'CGS system' for better clarity, especially in formal writing."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":[],"related_terms":["SI (International System of Units)","metre-kilogram-second (MKS)"],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency.

This allows the system to draw power from the grid when needed and, in many cases, to send excess power back to the grid, often earning credits or payments for the owner. It is the opposite of 'off-grid,' which means not connected to the electrical grid and relying on self-generated power.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ I live on grid.","correct":"✓ I have an on-grid system.","note":"'On-grid' is an adjective, so it needs to modify a noun.

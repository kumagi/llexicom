It is used to describe something that has the least amount of stability compared to others. While grammatically correct, it is not a commonly used word, and you would more often see 'most unstable' instead. It is best used in formal writing where a precise and concise description is needed, but be aware that some readers might find it unusual. It is important to ensure that the context clearly indicates that you are comparing multiple items or situations to determine which one is the least stable."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"This bridge is the unstablest structure in the city, according to the engineers.","translation":"エンジニアによると、この橋は市内で最も不安定な構造物です。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"Most unstable structure"},{"sentence":"Among all the isotopes, this one is the unstablest and decays the fastest.","translation":"すべての同位体の中で、これは最も不安定であり、最も速く崩壊します。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"Most unstable isotope"},{"sentence":"The political climate was at its unstablest during the period of civil unrest.","translation":"政治情勢は、内乱の期間中に最も不安定でした。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"Most unstable political climate"}]}

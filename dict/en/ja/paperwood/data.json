In this case, it's paper and wood. It's often used as a cheaper alternative to regular wood, especially in furniture making. Because it's made from paper, it can sometimes be considered a more sustainable option, especially if the paper is recycled. However, it's generally not as strong or durable as solid wood. You might see it used in things like shelving, drawers, or other parts of furniture that don't need to be super strong.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The desk is constructed from a sturdy paperwood.","translation":"その机は丈夫なペーパーウッドで作られている。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"複合材料"},{"sentence":"They chose paperwood because it was a more environmentally friendly option.","translation":"彼らは、より環境に優しい選択肢だったため、ペーパーウッドを選んだ。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"複合材料"}]}

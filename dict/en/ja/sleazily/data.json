The 'sleazy' meaning evolved to describe something cheap, flimsy, or of poor quality, and then extended to morally degraded or disreputable. The adverb 'sleazily' simply adds the '-ly' suffix to 'sleazy.'","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"ˈsliːzɪli","syllables":"slee-zi-ly"},"inflection":{"notes":"Adverb: no inflection"},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Sleazily' describes actions, behaviors, or environments that are characterized by a lack of moral principles, cheapness, or a general sense of being disreputable.

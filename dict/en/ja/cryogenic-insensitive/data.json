It describes something that doesn't change or get damaged when it's very, very cold. If something is 'cryogenic-insensitive,' it can work well even at extremely low temperatures, like those used in scientific experiments or in certain types of technology. It's the opposite of something that's 'cryogenic-sensitive,' which would be affected by the cold."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The telescope's detectors are made from a cryogenic-insensitive alloy to ensure accurate measurements.","translation":"望遠鏡の検出器は、正確な測定を保証するために、極低温に影響を受けない合金で作られています。","type":"example","meaning_category":"Material property"},{"sentence":"We selected a cryogenic-insensitive adhesive to bond the components of the sensor.","translation":"センサーのコンポーネントを接着するために、極低温に影響を受けない接着剤を選択しました。","type":"example","meaning_category":"Material selection"}]}

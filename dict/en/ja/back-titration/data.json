Instead of directly reacting a solution of known concentration (titrant) with the analyte, an excess amount of the titrant is added to the analyte. The excess titrant is then reacted with another solution of known concentration. By knowing how much of the second solution was used, one can calculate how much of the excess titrant was left over from the initial reaction with the analyte. This allows for the calculation of the amount of the analyte. Back-titration is useful when the direct reaction is slow or difficult to observe.","priority":"★☆☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"In the back-titration, excess hydrochloric acid was added to the calcium carbonate sample.","translation":"逆滴定では、過剰の塩酸を炭酸カルシウムのサンプルに加えました。","type":"example","meaning_category":"general"},{"sentence":"The endpoint of the back-titration was determined using an indicator.","translation":"逆滴定の終点は、指示薬を用いて決定されました。","type":"example","meaning_category":"procedure"},{"sentence":"The concentration of the analyte was calculated based on the results of the back-titration.","translation":"分析対象物の濃度は、逆滴定の結果に基づいて計算されました。","type":"example","meaning_category":"calculation"}]}

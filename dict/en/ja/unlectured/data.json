It is most often used in academic contexts to describe a situation where a subject or group of people has not received a formal lecture. The word implies a lack of instruction or teaching through a lecture format. Because of its infrequent use, it is more likely to be encountered in written academic texts rather than in everyday conversation."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The material remained **unlectured** due to time constraints.","translation":"時間的制約のため、その教材は講義されなかった。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"講義されていない"},{"sentence":"The **unlectured** students had to rely on self-study.","translation":"講義を受けなかった学生たちは、自習に頼らざるを得なかった。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"講義を受けていない"}]}

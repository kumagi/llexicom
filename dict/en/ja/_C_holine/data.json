Choline is important for several functions, including cell structure, cell messaging, fat transport and metabolism, and DNA synthesis.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ I take choline to improve my memory, but it don't work.","correct":"✓ I take choline to improve my memory, but it doesn't work.","note":"Subject-verb agreement: 'it' is singular, so the verb should be 'doesn't' instead of 'don't'."},{"incorrect":"✗ Choline is a vitamin.","correct":"✓ Choline is a vitamin-like essential nutrient.","note":"Choline is often grouped with B vitamins, but it is not technically a vitamin.

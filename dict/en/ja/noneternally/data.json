It is best used in philosophical or abstract discussions where the impermanence or transient nature of something needs to be emphasized. It is formed by adding the prefix 'non-' to 'eternally,' indicating the opposite of eternal or everlasting. Due to its rarity, it should be used with caution and only when the context clearly calls for such a precise term."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The artist sought to capture the beauty of the flower, knowing it bloomed noneternally.","translation":"芸術家は、花が永遠に咲き誇るわけではないことを知りながら、その美しさを捉えようとした。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"一時的に"},{"sentence":"We experience joy and sorrow, understanding that both exist noneternally in our lives.","translation":"喜びと悲しみを経験し、その両方が私たちの人生において永遠ではない形で存在することを理解する。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"永続的でない"}]}

'Channel' comes from the Latin word 'canalis,' meaning 'canal' or 'pipe.' The suffix '-ize' means 'to make' or 'to convert into.' Therefore, 'channelize' means 'to make into a channel' or 'to direct through a channel.' The addition of '-ing' creates the present participle or gerund form.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/ˈtʃænəlaɪzɪŋ/","syllables":"chan-nel-iz-ing"},"inflection":{"verb_forms":{"present_participle":"channelizing"}},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Channelizing' is the present participle or gerund form of the verb 'channelize.'

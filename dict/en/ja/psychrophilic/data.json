These organisms have adapted to function optimally at low temperatures, often below 15°C. They are commonly found in polar regions, deep sea environments, and refrigerated foods. It's important to note the distinction between psychrophiles and psychrotolerant organisms; psychrophiles require cold temperatures for growth, whereas psychrotolerant organisms can tolerate cold temperatures but grow better at moderate temperatures.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The psychrophilic plant grew well in the desert.","correct":"✓ The psychrophilic bacteria grew well in the cold environment.","note":"Psychrophilic organisms thrive in cold environments, not hot ones like deserts."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["psychrophile (noun: a psychrophilic organism)","psychrotolerant (adjective: cold-tolerant, but grows better at moderate temperatures)","psychrotolerant (noun: a psychrotolerant organism)"],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"level":"Technical","frequency_google_ngram":"Low","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Psychrophilic' is a technical term used in biology and microbiology to describe organisms that thrive in cold environments.

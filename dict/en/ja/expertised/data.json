However, it is rarely used in contemporary English. Instead of using 'expertised,' it is more common and natural to use alternative phrases such as 'provided expertise,' 'advised,' or 'consulted.' This is because 'expertised' sounds awkward or unnatural to many native English speakers. Therefore, it is best to avoid using 'expertised' and opt for more common and natural alternatives."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The consultant expertised the company on its marketing strategy.","translation":"コンサルタントは会社のマーケティング戦略について専門的なアドバイスを提供した。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"専門知識を提供する"},{"sentence":"He expertised the team in the latest software development techniques.","translation":"彼はチームに最新のソフトウェア開発技術に関する専門知識を伝授した。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"専門知識を提供する"}]}

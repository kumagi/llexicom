Originating in the 19th century at the Café Tortoni in Vienna (though named after Luigi Tortoni, an Italian chef), it's traditionally composed of layers of zabaglione or ice cream, fruit, and sponge cake. It’s known for its elegant presentation – often molded into a dome shape. While historically featuring zabaglione, modern variations can include different flavors and ingredients.  It’s considered a sophisticated dessert often served in upscale restaurants."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The restaurant's signature dessert was a magnificent **tortoni** with pistachio ice cream and candied cherries.","translation":"そのレストランの看板デザートは、ピスタチオアイスクリームと砂糖漬けチェリーを使った壮麗なトルトーニでした。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"dessert name"},{"sentence":"He ordered a **tortoni** to celebrate his anniversary.","translation":"彼は記念日を祝ってトルトーニを注文しました。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"dessert name"},{"sentence":"The chef carefully layered the zabaglione and fruit to create a perfect **tortoni**.","translation":"シェフは、完璧なトルトーニを作るために、ザバイオーネとフルーツを丁寧に重ねました。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"dessert name"}]}

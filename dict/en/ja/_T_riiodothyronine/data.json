T3 is the more active form of thyroid hormone and has a greater effect on the body's metabolism. It affects nearly every physiological process in the body, including growth and development, metabolism, body temperature, and heart rate. T3 levels in the blood are often measured to diagnose thyroid disorders such as hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid) and hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid).","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Triiodothyronine is a type of vitamin.","correct":"✓ Triiodothyronine is a type of thyroid hormone.","note":"Triiodothyronine is a hormone, not a vitamin."},{"incorrect":"✗ High levels of triiodothyronine always indicate good health.","correct":"✓ High levels of triiodothyronine can indicate hyperthyroidism.","note":"High levels of triiodothyronine can indicate hyperthyroidism, an overactive thyroid, which is not a sign of good health."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["thyroxine (T4)","thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)","hyperthyroidism","hypothyroidism"],"phrasal_verbs":null,"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency - Primarily used in medical and scientific contexts.","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C2","text":"'Triiodothyronine' is a specialized term predominantly used in medical and scientific contexts.

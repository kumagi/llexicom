This term is commonly used in materials science, chemistry, and biology, particularly in the context of cryopreservation (the preservation of biological materials by cooling to very low temperatures). High vitrifiability is often desirable in applications where a non-crystalline structure is needed, as it can improve material properties or preserve biological structures.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The vitrification is high.","correct":"✓ The vitrifiability is high.","note":"'Vitrification' is the process, while 'vitrifiability' is the ability to undergo that process."},{"incorrect":"✗ It has good vitrified.","correct":"✓ It has good vitrifiability.","note":"'Vitrified' is the past participle of the verb 'vitrify,' while 'vitrifiability' is the noun."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["vitrify (verb): ガラス化する","vitrification (noun): ガラス化","vitrified (adjective): ガラス化した"],"related_terms":["cryopreservation","glass transition","amorphous solid","crystallization"],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Vitrifiability' is a technical term primarily used in scientific and engineering contexts.

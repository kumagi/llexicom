It is formed by adding the prefix 'un-' (not) and the suffix '-ly' (adverbial form) to the adjective 'mortified,' which means feeling deeply ashamed or humiliated. Therefore, 'unmortifiedly' means acting in a way that is the opposite of feeling ashamed or humiliated. Due to its rarity and complexity, this word is typically only encountered in advanced academic or literary contexts."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The politician, despite the scandal, unmortifiedly continued his campaign.","translation":"その政治家は、スキャンダルにもかかわらず、平然と選挙活動を続けた。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"shamelessly"},{"sentence":"She unmortifiedly demanded a refund, even though she had clearly damaged the product.","translation":"彼女は明らかに製品を破損させたにもかかわらず、平然と払い戻しを要求した。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"brazenly"}]}

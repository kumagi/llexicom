{"topic":"Radiometry","description":"Radiometry is the measurement of electromagnetic radiation, including visible light. Radiometric techniques characterize the flow of optical radiation, quantifying its intensity, power, and spectral distribution. It is distinct from photometry, which measures light as perceived by the human eye.","related_terms":["Irradiance","Radiant Intensity","Radiance","Radiant Flux","Spectral Radiance","Blackbody Radiation","Planck's Law","Stefan-Boltzmann Law","Emissivity","Reflectance","Transmittance","Optical Power","Photodetector","Spectroradiometer","Thermal Radiation","Infrared Radiation","Ultraviolet Radiation","Electromagnetic Spectrum","Solid Angle","Steradian"],"applications":["Remote Sensing","Astronomy","Medical Imaging","Industrial Process Control","Environmental Monitoring","Climate Science","Lighting Design","Display Technology","Optical Metrology","Defense and Security"],"instruments":["Radiometer","Spectroradiometer","Pyranometer","Pyrgeometer","Bolometer","Photodiode","CCD (Charge-Coupled Device)","Thermal Camera"],"units":["Watt (W)","Watt per Steradian (W/sr)","Watt per Square Meter (W/m²)","Watt per Steradian per Square Meter (W/sr/m²)","Watt per Square Meter per Nanometer (W/m²/nm)"],"japanese_translations":{"radiometry":"放射測定","irradiance":"放射照度","radiant_intensity":"放射強度","radiance":"放射輝度","radiant_flux":"放射束","spectral_radiance":"分光放射輝度","blackbody_radiation":"黒体放射","emissivity":"放射率","reflectance":"反射率","transmittance":"透過率","optical_power":"光パワー","photodetector":"光検出器","spectroradiometer":"分光放射計","thermal_radiation":"熱放射","infrared_radiation":"赤外線放射","ultraviolet_radiation":"紫外線放射","remote_sensing":"リモートセンシング","astronomy":"天文学","medical_imaging":"医用画像処理","watt":"ワット"},"notes":"This JSON provides a basic overview of radiometry and related terms with Japanese translations.

The reaction involves treating a primary aromatic amine with nitrous acid (generated in situ from sodium nitrite and a mineral acid) at low temperatures (typically 0-5 °C) to form a tetrazonium salt. Tetrazonium salts are versatile intermediates that can undergo various reactions, such as coupling with aromatic compounds to form azo dyes, or replacement of the diazonium group with other functional groups.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The tetrazotization reaction requires high temperatures.","correct":"✓ The tetrazotization reaction requires low temperatures.","note":"Tetrazotization reactions are typically carried out at low temperatures (0-5°C) to prevent decomposition of the diazonium salt."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["tetrazonium salt","azo dye","diazonium salt","diazotization"],"related_terms":["amine","nitrous acid","sodium nitrite","coupling reaction"],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Tetrazotization' is a technical term used in organic chemistry to describe a specific chemical reaction.

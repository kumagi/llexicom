This interaction is crucial in pharmacology, biochemistry, and physiology.

It describes the interaction between a protein and another molecule, such as a drug or hormone. Understanding protein-binding is important for predicting how a drug will behave in the body, as it affects its distribution, metabolism, and excretion. High protein-binding generally means less free drug is available to exert its effects, while low protein-binding means more free drug is available. This term is typically encountered in scientific literature, research papers, and medical contexts."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The protein-binding of warfarin is approximately 99%.","translation":"ワルファリンのタンパク質結合は約99%である。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"タンパク質結合"},{"sentence":"This new drug exhibits low protein-binding, resulting in a higher concentration of free drug in the plasma.","translation":"この新薬は低いタンパク質結合性を示し、血漿中の遊離薬物の濃度が高くなる。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"タンパク質結合性"}]}

It refers to a group of fungi that share a specific characteristic: their spores develop in asci (sac-like structures) that are not enclosed within a larger fruiting body. This term is primarily encountered in scientific literature and specialized texts on fungal taxonomy. Because modern classification methods have evolved, the term is less frequently used in contemporary research, but it remains relevant for understanding the historical context of fungal classification."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"Phylogenetic analysis has led to the reclassification of many species formerly placed in the Hemiascales.","translation":"系統解析により、かつてヘミアスカレスに分類されていた多くの種が再分類されました。","type":"general","meaning_category":"taxonomy"}]}

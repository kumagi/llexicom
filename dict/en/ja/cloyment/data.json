It refers to the state of being excessively full or satisfied, often to the point of causing disgust or aversion. It is derived from the verb 'to cloy,' meaning to satiate or sicken with excess. Due to its rarity, it is more likely to be encountered in older literature or historical texts than in contemporary conversation or writing. When describing a similar concept in modern English, words like 'satiety,' 'surfeit,' or 'excess' are more commonly used."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The rich, sugary dessert resulted in a feeling of **cloyment** that lingered for hours.","translation":"その濃厚で甘いデザートは、何時間も続く飽き飽きした感覚をもたらした。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"飽満"},{"sentence":"After weeks of constant praise, he began to experience a **cloyment** of adulation.","translation":"数週間にわたる絶え間ない称賛の後、彼は賞賛の飽き飽きを経験し始めた。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"嫌気"}]}

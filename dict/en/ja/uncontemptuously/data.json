It's the opposite of acting 'contemptuously,' which would mean acting in a way that shows you think someone or something is worthless. This word is not very common and is usually used in formal writing or speech to emphasize that someone is being treated with respect, even if they might not deserve it. For example, you might say someone 'listened uncontemptuously' to a ridiculous idea, meaning they gave it a fair hearing without mocking it."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The judge listened to the defendant's plea uncontemptuously, despite the severity of the crime.","translation":"裁判官は、犯罪の重大さにもかかわらず、被告の訴えを軽蔑せずに聞いた。","type":"general"},{"sentence":"She responded to his criticism uncontemptuously, maintaining a professional demeanor.","translation":"彼女は彼の批判に軽蔑せずに答え、プロフェッショナルな態度を維持した。","type":"general"},{"sentence":"Even though he disagreed with her opinion, he treated her uncontemptuously during the debate.","translation":"彼は彼女の意見に反対していたにもかかわらず、討論中彼女を軽蔑せずに扱った。","type":"general"}]}

Imagine a video game where the computer figures out in advance how light will bounce off surfaces, so it doesn't have to do that math every time you move your character. That's precalculation. It's a technical term, so you'll mostly see it in fields like computer science, engineering, or mathematics."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The physics engine relies on extensive **precalculations** to simulate realistic movements.","translation":"その物理エンジンは、現実的な動きをシミュレートするために広範な事前計算に依存している。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"事前計算"},{"sentence":"Storing the results of **precalculations** significantly reduces the processing time.","translation":"事前計算の結果を保存することで、処理時間が大幅に短縮される。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"事前計算"},{"sentence":"The AI used **precalculations** to determine the optimal strategy.","translation":"そのAIは、最適な戦略を決定するために事前計算を使用した。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"事前計算"}]}

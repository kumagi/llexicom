This often involves stripping away its intrinsic value or cultural significance and treating it purely as a source of profit. The term is often used critically, implying that the commodification of something is undesirable or harmful.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The commodified is good.","correct":"✓ The commodified product is good.","note":"'Commodified' is an adjective or past participle, so it needs to modify a noun.

It's used when something loses its original value or meaning because it's now treated as a commodity. For example, if art is 'commodified,' it means it's being produced and sold primarily for profit, rather than for its artistic merit. This word is often used in discussions about economics, culture, and ethics."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The commodified healthcare system prioritizes profits over patient care.","translation":"商品化された医療制度は、患者のケアよりも利益を優先する。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"商品化された"},{"sentence":"The experience of travel has become increasingly commodified.","translation":"旅行の経験はますます商品化されている。","type":"verb (past participle)","meaning_category":"商品化された"},{"sentence":"Many argue that education should not be commodified.","translation":"教育は商品化されるべきではないと多くの人が主張している。","type":"verb (past participle)","meaning_category":"商品化された"},{"sentence":"Commodified information can lead to the spread of misinformation.","translation":"商品化された情報は、誤った情報の拡散につながる可能性がある。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"商品化された"}]}

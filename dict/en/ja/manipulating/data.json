It suggests that someone is being controlled or used in a way that benefits the manipulator, often without the other person's full awareness or consent. When referring to objects or data, it can simply mean handling or adjusting skillfully, without the negative implication. The key is whether the action is fair and transparent.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ He is manipulating with the computer.","correct":"✓ He is manipulating the computer.","note":"'Manipulate' is a transitive verb and usually takes a direct object without the preposition 'with' when referring to objects or data. When referring to people, 'manipulate' is often used directly, but sometimes 'into' is used to show the result of the manipulation (e.g., 'He manipulated her into doing what he wanted')."},{"incorrect":"✗ She is manipulating because she is strong.","correct":"✓ She is manipulating because she is dishonest/selfish.","note":"Manipulation is usually associated with dishonesty, selfishness, or a lack of empathy, not just strength.

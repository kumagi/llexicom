It's often used in discussions about artifice, abnormality, or things that deviate significantly from what is expected in the natural world or in human behavior. Because it's an abstract noun derived from 'unnatural,' it requires a good understanding of both the base adjective and the '-ness' suffix.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The **unnaturalness** of the perfectly symmetrical garden was striking.","translation":"完璧に左右対称な庭の不自然さは際立っていた。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"不自然さ"},{"sentence":"He couldn't shake off the feeling of **unnaturalness** surrounding the abandoned house.","translation":"彼はその廃屋を囲む不自然な感覚を振り払うことができなかった。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"異常さ"},{"sentence":"The **unnaturalness** of the robot's movements was a bit creepy.","translation":"ロボットの動きの奇異さは少し不気味だった。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"奇異さ"}]}

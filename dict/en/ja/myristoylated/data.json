This process involves the attachment of myristate, a 14-carbon saturated fatty acid, to the N-terminal glycine residue of a protein. Myristoylation often plays a crucial role in targeting proteins to cell membranes and regulating protein-protein interactions. It is a common post-translational modification in eukaryotic cells.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The protein is myristoylation.","correct":"✓ The protein is myristoylated.","note":"'Myristoylation' is the process, while 'myristoylated' is the state of being modified."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["myristoylation (noun): the process of adding myristate to a protein","myristoyl (noun): the acyl group derived from myristic acid","myristic acid (noun): a saturated fatty acid with 14 carbon atoms"],"priority":"★★★"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Myristoylated' is a technical term used in biochemistry and molecular biology.

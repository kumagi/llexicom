It does not mean they are immune, but rather that they experience milder symptoms or are less affected by the disease. This tolerance can be due to genetic factors, prior exposure, or other mechanisms.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"The vaccine makes people malaria-tolerant.","correct":"The vaccine aims to make people malaria-resistant.","note":"Vaccines typically aim for resistance (complete or near-complete protection), not just tolerance (ability to function despite infection)."},{"incorrect":"Malaria-tolerant means completely immune to malaria.","correct":"Malaria-tolerant means able to function despite being infected with malaria.","note":"Tolerance is not the same as immunity.

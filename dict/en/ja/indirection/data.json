In general usage, it refers to a lack of directness or straightforwardness, often implying a deliberate attempt to be evasive or subtle. In computer science, it refers to a programming technique where a value is accessed indirectly through a pointer or reference. This allows for more flexible and dynamic memory management and program design. The computing sense is a specialized application of the general sense.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ He used indirection to solve the problem directly.","correct":"✓ He used indirection to solve the problem indirectly.","note":"Indirection implies an indirect approach, so it cannot be used with \"directly.\" Replace 'directly' with 'indirectly'."},{"incorrect":"✗ The indirection of the story made it hard to follow.","correct":"✓ The indirectness of the story made it hard to follow.","note":"While 'indirection' is correct, 'indirectness' is more common and natural when referring to the quality of being indirect."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["indirect (adjective)","indirectly (adverb)"],"related_concepts":["pointer","reference","proxy","abstraction","delegation"],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C1","frequency_google_ngram":"Relatively low frequency, more common in technical contexts.","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"\"Indirection\" is a relatively advanced term that describes a lack of directness or a roundabout way of doing something. It's often used in computing to describe accessing data through a pointer or reference, rather than directly.

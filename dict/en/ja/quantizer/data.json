It converts continuous or high-resolution discrete signals into a finite set of discrete levels. This process inevitably introduces quantization error or noise, which is the difference between the original signal and its quantized representation. The design of a quantizer involves balancing the trade-off between the number of quantization levels and the resulting distortion.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The quantizer makes the signal continuous.","correct":"✓ The quantizer makes the signal discrete.","note":"Quantizers convert continuous signals into discrete signals, not the other way around."},{"incorrect":"✗ A good quantizer increases the signal resolution.","correct":"✓ A good quantizer preserves signal quality while reducing resolution.","note":"Quantizers reduce the resolution (number of bits) needed to represent a signal, but a good design aims to minimize the loss of signal quality."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["quantize","quantization"],"related_terms":["encoder","decoder","signal processing","data compression","audio compression","image compression"]},"level_frequency":{"frequency_google_ngram":"Relatively low frequency, primarily used in technical contexts.","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"The term 'quantizer' refers to a device or algorithm used in signal processing and data compression to reduce the number of possible values a signal can take.

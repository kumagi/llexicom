It's a term used in biology to describe DNA that isn't in its usual double helix form, but rather exists as a single strand. This is important in processes like DNA replication and sequencing. Think of it as one half of the DNA ladder, separated from its partner. It's mostly used in scientific contexts, so you'll find it in research papers and textbooks.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The researchers used ssDNA probes to detect specific gene sequences.","translation":"研究者らは、特定の遺伝子配列を検出するためにssDNAプローブを使用した。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"一本鎖DNA"},{"sentence":"The efficiency of DNA replication relies on the stability of ssDNA.","translation":"DNA複製の効率は、ssDNAの安定性に依存する。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"一本鎖DNA"},{"sentence":"The ssDNA was synthesized using a PCR reaction.","translation":"そのssDNAはPCR反応を用いて合成された。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"一本鎖DNA"}]}

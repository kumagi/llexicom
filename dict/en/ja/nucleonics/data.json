It's not something you encounter in everyday conversation! This discipline focuses on using atomic nuclei for things like generating power (nuclear reactors), medical treatments, and industrial processes.  It involves understanding how atoms behave, controlling nuclear reactions, and ensuring safety when working with radioactive materials. Because it’s so complex, you'll typically find this term used in scientific papers, engineering contexts, or discussions about energy policy."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"He specialized in **nucleonics** during his doctoral studies.","translation":"彼は博士課程で核工学を専攻した。","type":"general use","meaning_category":"field of study"},{"sentence":"Advances in **nucleonics** have led to more efficient nuclear power plants.","translation":"核工学の進歩により、より効率的な原子力発電所が実現した。","type":"general use","meaning_category":"advancements in the field"},{"sentence":"The conference covered various topics in **nucleonics**, including reactor design and safety protocols.","translation":"その会議では、原子炉設計や安全プロトコルなど、核工学の様々なテーマが取り上げられた。","type":"general use","meaning_category":"topics within the field"}]}

An operation is commutative if changing the order of the operands does not change the result. This property holds for addition and multiplication of real numbers, but not for subtraction or division. In higher mathematics, commutativity is a key concept in abstract algebra, particularly in the study of groups, rings, and fields.

It means that you can change the order of the numbers or elements you're operating on, and the result will be the same. For example, with addition, 2 + 3 is the same as 3 + 2. However, not all operations are commutative. For instance, subtraction (5 - 2 is not the same as 2 - 5) and matrix multiplication are generally not commutative.

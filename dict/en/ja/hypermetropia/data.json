It refers to a condition where you can see distant objects clearly, but close objects appear blurry. This happens because the eye focuses light behind the retina instead of directly on it. You might also hear it called 'farsightedness'. It's a word you're most likely to encounter when discussing eye health with a doctor or optometrist."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The optometrist diagnosed her with mild hypermetropia.","translation":"検眼医は彼女を軽度の遠視と診断した。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"medical condition"},{"sentence":"He needs glasses to correct his hypermetropia.","translation":"彼は遠視を矯正するために眼鏡が必要です。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"medical condition"}]}

This is often desirable in organic synthesis to control the reaction and prevent multiple bromines from attaching. Selectivity is a key consideration in monobromination reactions, as conditions must be optimized to favor the substitution of only one hydrogen atom by bromine.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The reaction resulted in dibromination instead of monobromination.","correct":"✓ The reaction resulted in dibromination instead of monobromination.","note":"This example is already correct; the common mistake is failing to specify the desired outcome (monobromination) versus the actual outcome (dibromination)."},{"incorrect":"✗ Monobromination is when you add many bromines.","correct":"✓ Monobromination is when you add one bromine.","note":"The prefix 'mono-' indicates 'one' or 'single,' so it's incorrect to associate it with multiple additions."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["monobrominated (adjective)"],"related_terms":["bromination","halogenation","chlorination","iodination","electrophilic substitution","free radical substitution"],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Monobromination' is a technical term used in organic chemistry.

These capacitors were designed so that the frequency of the tuned circuit would change linearly as the capacitor's control knob was rotated. However, this design resulted in a non-linear scale on the radio dial, making it harder to tune to specific frequencies.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ straight line frequency","correct":"✓ straight-line-frequency","note":"The correct term includes hyphens to indicate it's a compound adjective."}],"priority":"★☆☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":[],"related_terms":["variable capacitor","radio receiver","frequency tuning","straight-line-capacity"],"abbreviations":["SLF"],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"N/A","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency - technical term related to radio engineering.","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Straight-line-frequency' is a technical term used in the context of radio engineering, particularly when discussing older radio receiver designs.

It's commonly used in contexts related to cryptography, signal processing, and genetics. In cryptography, it means deciphering an encrypted message. In signal processing, it refers to converting a signal into a usable format. In genetics, it can refer to understanding the genetic code. The noun form refers to the result or process of decoding, while the verb form (as a present participle) describes the action of decoding.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ I am decoding the secret with a key.","correct":"✓ I am decoding the secret message with a key.","note":"'Decoding' typically applies to a message, signal, or code, not a general 'secret.'"},{"incorrect":"✗ The decoding was very easy because the code was simply.","correct":"✓ The decoding was very easy because the code was simple.","note":"The correct adjective to use is 'simple,' not 'simply.'"}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["decode (verb): to convert a coded message into intelligible language.","decoder (noun): a device or program that decodes something.","encoding (noun): the process of converting information into a coded form.","code (noun): a system of signals or symbols used to represent something.","cipher (noun): a secret or disguised way of writing; a code."],"priority":"★★★"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"B2","frequency_google_ngram":"Relatively frequent, especially in technical contexts.","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"B2","text":"'Decoding' means figuring out the meaning of something that's in code or not easily understood.

It's commonly used in fields like computer science, physics, and mathematics. To understand it, break it down: 'arrangement' refers to the way things are organized, and 'independent' means not relying on something else. So, 'arrangement-independent' means not relying on a particular arrangement. For example, an algorithm might be arrangement-independent if it produces the same result no matter how the input data is ordered."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The hashing algorithm is designed to be arrangement-independent to ensure consistent performance.","translation":"そのハッシュアルゴリズムは、一貫したパフォーマンスを保証するために、配置に依存しないように設計されています。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"Not dependent on arrangement"},{"sentence":"The physical properties of the material are arrangement-independent at the macroscopic level.","translation":"材料の物理的特性は、巨視的なレベルでは配置に依存しません。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"Not dependent on arrangement"}]}

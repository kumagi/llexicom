It's a noun or phrase that sits next to another noun to describe it further. Think of it as extra information. If the extra information is important to understanding which noun you're talking about, it's called 'restrictive' and doesn't need commas. If it's just extra detail, it's 'nonrestrictive' and needs commas around it. This is a more advanced grammar concept, so it's usually encountered at higher levels of English proficiency."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"My dog, a golden retriever, loves to play fetch.","translation":"私の犬、ゴールデンレトリバーですが、ボール遊びが大好きです。","type":"example","meaning_category":"general"},{"sentence":"Shakespeare, the famous playwright, wrote many tragedies.","translation":"シェイクスピア、有名な劇作家は、多くの悲劇を書きました。","type":"example","meaning_category":"general"},{"sentence":"The CEO, Ms. Johnson, announced the company's profits.","translation":"CEOのジョンソン氏は、会社の利益を発表しました。","type":"example","meaning_category":"general"}]}

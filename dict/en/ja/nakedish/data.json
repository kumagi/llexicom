The suffix '-ish' indicates a quality or condition that is somewhat or approximately like the base word.

It is often used to avoid being too direct or explicit. The '-ish' suffix softens the meaning, suggesting an approximation rather than a complete state.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ She was completely nakedish.","correct":"✓ She was almost naked. / ✓ She was nakedish.","note":"'Nakedish' implies a partial state, so using 'completely' is contradictory.

It's used to describe a state that is close to being naked but not entirely so. It can also describe something that is minimally embellished or close to its natural state. Because it's not a formal word, it's more common in casual conversation or writing. Be mindful of the context to understand whether it refers to clothing or a lack thereof, or to a style that is simple and unadorned."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The model wore a nakedish gown that shimmered under the lights.","translation":"モデルはライトの下で輝く、ほとんど裸のようなガウンを着ていた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"Clothing"},{"sentence":"She preferred a nakedish palette of eyeshadows for a natural look.","translation":"彼女はナチュラルなルックのために、ほとんど素肌のようなアイシャドウパレットを好んだ。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"Makeup"},{"sentence":"He felt nakedish without his usual accessories.","translation":"彼はいつものアクセサリーがないとほとんど裸のように感じた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"Feeling"}]}

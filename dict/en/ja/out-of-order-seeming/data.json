It combines the phrase 'out of order' (meaning not working or not in the correct sequence) with the suffix '-seeming' (meaning appearing or giving the impression of being). It's used to describe the *impression* something gives, even if it's not actually confirmed to be broken or disorganized. Because of its length and complexity, it's not a common word and would be more likely found in written text where precise description is needed."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The elevator had an out-of-order-seeming sign, but someone was using it.","translation":"そのエレベーターは故障中のように見えるサインが出ていたが、誰かが使っていた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"malfunctioning appearance"},{"sentence":"The files were arranged in an out-of-order-seeming manner, making it difficult to find anything.","translation":"ファイルは秩序を欠いているように見える方法で配置されており、何も見つけるのが難しかった。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"disorganized appearance"},{"sentence":"Despite its out-of-order-seeming appearance, the old computer still worked perfectly.","translation":"故障しているように見える外観にもかかわらず、その古いコンピュータはまだ完璧に動作した。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"broken appearance"}]}

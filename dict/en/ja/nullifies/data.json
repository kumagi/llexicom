It often implies a legal or official action that cancels out a previous agreement, law, or decision. The subject performing the action of nullifying is usually an authority such as a court, government, or organization. It is stronger than simply disagreeing with something; it means to make it as if it never existed or had any effect.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ He tried to nullify with her.","correct":"✓ He tried to nullify the agreement.","note":"'Nullify' is a transitive verb, so it needs a direct object (what is being nullified).

It involves intentionally introducing a distortion that is the inverse of the distortion expected from a transmission channel or device.

It refers to a method where a signal is intentionally altered *before* it's transmitted or processed. This alteration is designed to counteract or cancel out any distortions that the signal is expected to encounter along the way (e.g., during transmission through a cable or amplification by an amplifier). The goal is to ensure that the signal received at the other end is as close as possible to the original, undistorted signal. It's a complex concept often involving advanced signal processing techniques.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The system uses digital predistortion to improve the efficiency of the power amplifier.","translation":"そのシステムは、電力増幅器の効率を向上させるためにデジタルプリディストーションを使用しています。","type":"general","meaning_category":"電気工学における技術"},{"sentence":"Without predistortion, the signal would be significantly degraded by the amplifier's non-linearities.","translation":"プリディストーションがないと、信号は増幅器の非線形性によって著しく劣化するでしょう。","type":"general","meaning_category":"電気工学における技術"},{"sentence":"Adaptive predistortion algorithms can adjust to changing channel conditions.","translation":"適応型プリディストーションアルゴリズムは、変化するチャネル条件に合わせて調整できます。","type":"technical","meaning_category":"電気工学における技術"}]}

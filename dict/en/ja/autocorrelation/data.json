It is commonly used in time series analysis to identify patterns and dependencies in data that evolve over time. A high autocorrelation suggests that past values of the variable are good predictors of future values. The autocorrelation function (ACF) is a plot of the autocorrelation values for different time lags, which helps in identifying the presence and strength of periodic patterns.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The data has no autocorrelation, so it is stationary.","correct":"✓ The data has low autocorrelation, so it is likely stationary.","note":"Low autocorrelation is an indicator of stationarity, but not the only factor.

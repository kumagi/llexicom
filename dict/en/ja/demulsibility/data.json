Good demulsibility ensures that water can be easily removed, preventing corrosion, sludge formation, and other problems.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The demulsibility is high when the oil forms a stable emulsion.","correct":"✓ The demulsibility is low when the oil forms a stable emulsion.","note":"High demulsibility means the oil separates easily from water; low demulsibility means it forms a stable emulsion with water."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["demulsify (verb)","demulsification (noun)","emulsion (noun)","emulsifier (noun)","emulsibility (noun)"],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency - technical term used in specific fields.","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"'Demulsibility' is a technical term primarily used in chemistry, engineering, and related fields, particularly when discussing lubricants and hydraulic fluids. It describes how easily a fluid can separate from an emulsion, especially a water-in-oil emulsion. A fluid with high demulsibility separates readily from water, which is generally desirable to prevent issues like corrosion and sludge formation.

While it literally means 'nose brain,' it was historically used to describe a larger region of the brain thought to be primarily involved in olfaction. Modern research has shown that many of the structures once considered part of the rhinencephalon have functions beyond olfaction, such as memory and emotion. Therefore, it's more accurate to refer to specific brain structures involved in olfaction, such as the olfactory bulb, olfactory cortex, and parts of the amygdala and hippocampus, rather than using the umbrella term 'rhinencephalon'.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The rhinencephalon is only involved in smell.","correct":"✓ The rhinencephalon was once thought to be primarily involved in smell, but we now know it has other functions.","note":"While the rhinencephalon is related to smell, it's not its only function, and the term is somewhat outdated."}],"priority":"★☆☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["rhinencephalic (adjective)"],"phrasal_verbs":[],"priority":"★☆☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Very low frequency","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C2","text":"The term 'rhinencephalon' refers to the part of the brain related to the sense of smell.

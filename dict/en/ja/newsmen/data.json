While it was once a common term, it is now considered outdated and less inclusive because it excludes female journalists. In contemporary English, it is more appropriate to use gender-neutral terms such as 'journalists,' 'reporters,' or 'news media' to refer to individuals working in the news industry, regardless of their gender.

It's a technical term used when it's very important that something is airtight, like in electronics or food packaging. If something has high 'hermeticity,' it means it's very well sealed. The word comes from the idea of something being sealed so perfectly that it's like the secrets of alchemy, which were often kept in sealed containers.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The **hermeticity** of the sensor package is essential for accurate measurements.","translation":"センサーパッケージの密閉性は、正確な測定に不可欠です。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"密閉性"},{"sentence":"Engineers are working to improve the **hermeticity** of the fuel cell.","translation":"エンジニアは燃料電池の密閉性を向上させるために取り組んでいます。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"密閉性"},{"sentence":"The **hermeticity** test confirmed that the seal was intact.","translation":"密閉性試験により、シールが無傷であることが確認された。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"密閉性"}]}

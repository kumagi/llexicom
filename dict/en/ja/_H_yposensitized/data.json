It refers to the state of a person after they have undergone a medical procedure called hyposensitization (or desensitization or immunotherapy). This procedure involves gradually exposing the person to increasing doses of an allergen (a substance that causes an allergic reaction) to reduce their sensitivity to it. The term is not commonly used outside of medical contexts. Understanding this word requires familiarity with basic concepts of allergies and medical treatments.","translation":"「Hyposensitized」は医学、特にアレルギーと免疫学の分野で使用される専門用語です。これは、減感作療法（または脱感作療法、免疫療法とも呼ばれます）と呼ばれる医療処置を受けた後の人の状態を指します。この処置では、アレルギー反応を引き起こすアレルゲン（アレルギー反応を引き起こす物質）に徐々にさらすことで、アレルゲンに対する感受性を低下させます。この用語は、医療以外の文脈では一般的に使用されません。この単語を理解するには、アレルギーと医療処置の基本的な概念を理解する必要があります。"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The child was successfully **hyposensitized** to peanuts, allowing him to eat them without a reaction.","translation":"その子供はピーナッツに対する減感作療法に成功し、アレルギー反応を起こさずに食べられるようになった。","type":"verb (past participle)","meaning_category":"減感作された"},{"sentence":"The **hyposensitized** patient still carries an epinephrine auto-injector as a precaution.","translation":"減感作された患者は、念のためアドレナリン自己注射器を今も携帯している。","type":"adjective (implied)","meaning_category":"減感作された"}]}

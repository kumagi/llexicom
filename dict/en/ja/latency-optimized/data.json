It describes systems, components, or algorithms that have been specifically designed or configured to minimize the delay (latency) in data processing or transmission. This is particularly important in applications where real-time responsiveness is critical, such as online gaming, high-frequency trading, and real-time data analytics. The term implies a focus on reducing any delays that could negatively impact performance or user experience.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The latency-optimized is very good.","correct":"✓ The latency-optimized system is very good.","note":"'Latency-optimized' is an adjective and needs to modify a noun.

'Latency' refers to the time it takes for data to travel from one point to another, and 'optimized' means it has been improved to work as efficiently as possible. So, 'latency-optimized' means that something has been specifically engineered to minimize those delays. This term is commonly used when discussing networks, databases, or algorithms where speed and responsiveness are critical.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The company developed a latency-optimized storage solution for financial institutions.","translation":"その会社は、金融機関向けに遅延が最適化されたストレージソリューションを開発しました。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"describing a system"},{"sentence":"Latency-optimization is a key factor in improving the performance of cloud-based applications.","translation":"遅延最適化は、クラウドベースのアプリケーションのパフォーマンスを向上させるための重要な要素です。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"describing a process"},{"sentence":"They used a latency-optimized kernel to reduce the response time of the server.","translation":"彼らは、サーバーの応答時間を短縮するために、遅延が最適化されたカーネルを使用しました。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"describing a kernel"}]}

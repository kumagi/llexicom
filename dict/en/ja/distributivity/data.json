The most common example is multiplication over addition, where a(b + c) = ab + ac. This means that multiplying a number by the sum of two other numbers is the same as multiplying the number by each of the other numbers separately and then adding the products. Understanding distributivity is essential for algebra and higher-level mathematics.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The distributive property, or distributivity, is a key concept in algebra.","translation":"分配性、すなわち分配法則は、代数学における重要な概念です。","type":"definition"},{"sentence":"Distributivity allows us to expand expressions like 2(x + 3) into 2x + 6.","translation":"分配性によって、2(x + 3)のような式を2x + 6に展開することができます。","type":"example"},{"sentence":"The distributive law is used to simplify complex mathematical equations.","translation":"分配法則は、複雑な数式を簡略化するために用いられます。","type":"application"}]}

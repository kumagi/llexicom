This concept is important in various fields, including physics, ecology, geography, and computer science. It implies that a simple, universal explanation may not be possible, and that the scale of analysis must be carefully considered.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The result is scale-dependant.","correct":"✓ The result is scale-dependent.","note":"Correct spelling is 'scale-dependent' with an 'e' after 'depend'."},{"incorrect":"✗ This is a scale-independent phenomenon, so it is not scale-dependent.","correct":"✓ This is a scale-independent phenomenon.","note":"Avoid using contradictory terms in the same sentence.

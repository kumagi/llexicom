It refers to a unit of power within the CGS (centimeter-gram-second) system of units. Due to the widespread adoption of the SI (International System of Units), 'abwatts' is rarely encountered in modern contexts. Understanding this term is generally only relevant for those studying the history of physics or working with legacy scientific literature."},"example_sentences":[]}

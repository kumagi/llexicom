Inductive reasoning involves making general conclusions based on specific observations. A semi-inductive approach might combine this with deductive reasoning (starting with general principles and applying them to specific cases) or with pre-existing knowledge. This term is often used in technical fields like machine learning to describe algorithms that use both data and prior knowledge to make predictions or generalizations.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The researchers developed a semi-inductive model to predict customer behavior based on historical data and demographic information.","translation":"研究者たちは、過去のデータと人口統計情報に基づいて顧客行動を予測するための準帰納的モデルを開発した。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"reasoning"},{"sentence":"A semi-inductive method was used to identify patterns in the gene expression data.","translation":"遺伝子発現データにおけるパターンを特定するために、半帰納的な手法が用いられた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"methodology"}]}

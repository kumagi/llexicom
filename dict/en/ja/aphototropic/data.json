Phototropism is the directional growth of an organism in response to a light stimulus. An aphototropic organism will grow or move independently of the direction of light. This term is often used in the context of scientific research, particularly in genetics and plant physiology, to describe mutant organisms or species with altered light responses.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The plant is aphototrophic.","correct":"✓ The plant is aphototropic.","note":"Aphototropic refers to the lack of phototropism (growth in response to light direction), while aphototrophic refers to not being able to use light for energy (like photosynthesis)."},{"incorrect":"✗ Aphototropic plants grow towards the light.","correct":"✓ Aphototropic plants do not grow towards the light.","note":"By definition, aphototropic plants do not exhibit directional growth in response to light."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["aphototropism (名詞: 光屈性の欠如)"],"related_terms":["phototropism (名詞: 光屈性)","phototropic (形容詞: 光屈性の)","tropism (名詞: 屈性)"],"priority":"★★★"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"低頻度 (Low frequency) - 専門用語","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"The term \"aphototropic\" is a scientific term used to describe organisms that do not exhibit phototropism. Phototropism is the growth or movement of an organism in response to a light stimulus. Therefore, an aphototropic organism is one that does not grow or move in response to light. This term is primarily used in the context of biology, particularly in plant physiology and genetics, when discussing mutants or species that lack the typical light-directed growth response.

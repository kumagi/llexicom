The suffix '-tic' means 'relating to'. Therefore, 'electrolytic' describes something related to the process of breaking down a substance using electricity.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/ɪˌlɛktrəˈlɪtɪk/","syllables":"e-lec-tro-ly-tic"},"inflection":{"notes":"It is an adjective and does not have plural forms."},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Electrolytic' is primarily used in scientific and technical contexts, especially in chemistry, physics, and engineering.

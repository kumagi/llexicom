It's a shortened version of 'Got you', used to indicate understanding or acknowledgement. Due to its informality, it's best used among friends or in casual settings. Avoid using it in formal conversations, business communications, or when speaking to someone in a position of authority.

It's like saying 'Okay' or 'I got it', but in a more casual way. You would only use this with friends or people you know well. It's not something you would say to your boss or teacher. Think of it as a slang word that means 'I understand you'. Be careful when you use it, because it's not appropriate in all situations."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"A: \"Don't forget to lock the door.\" B: \"Gotcher!\"","translation":"A: 「ドアをロックするのを忘れないで。」 B: 「了解！」","type":"interjection","meaning_category":"了解"},{"sentence":"A: \"The deadline is next Friday.\" B: \"Gotcher, I'll make sure to submit it on time.\"","translation":"A: 「締め切りは来週の金曜日です。」 B: 「承知しました。期日までに提出するようにします。」","type":"interjection","meaning_category":"承知"}]}

Therefore, 'deceiving-looking' describes something whose appearance is intended to or tends to deceive.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/dɪˈsiːvɪŋ ˈlʊkɪŋ/","syllables":"de-ceiv-ing-look-ing"},"inflection":{"notes":"As an adjective, 'deceiving-looking' does not have plural forms or comparative/superlative degrees."},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Deceiving-looking' is used to describe something that has an appearance that is not representative of its true nature.

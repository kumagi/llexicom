It involves adding up the values of data units (bytes, words, etc.) in a block of data. The resulting sum is then used as a checksum. When the data is received or retrieved, the checksum is recalculated. If the recalculated checksum matches the original checksum, it suggests that the data has not been corrupted. Checksums are not foolproof and can miss certain types of errors, but they are computationally inexpensive and widely used for basic data integrity checks.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The checksum are incorrect.","correct":"✓ The checksum is incorrect.","note":"'Checksum' is treated as a singular noun, even though it represents a sum of multiple values."},{"incorrect":"✗ Checksuming the file.","correct":"✓ Calculating the checksum of the file.","note":"'Checksuming' is not a standard verb.

It's like a unique fingerprint for the data. Before sending or saving the data, a checksum is calculated. When the data is received or opened later, the checksum is calculated again. If the two checksums match, it means the data is likely the same as it was originally. If they don't match, it means the data has been altered in some way. Checksums are a simple but useful tool for ensuring data integrity. They are commonly used in file downloads, network communications, and data storage.","priority":"★★★"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The software uses a checksum to ensure the integrity of the downloaded files.","translation":"そのソフトウェアは、ダウンロードされたファイルの整合性を保証するためにチェックサムを使用します。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"error detection"},{"sentence":"A checksum error indicates that the data has been corrupted during transmission.","translation":"チェックサムエラーは、データが送信中に破損したことを示します。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"error indication"},{"sentence":"We need to calculate the checksum before sending the data.","translation":"データを送信する前にチェックサムを計算する必要があります。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"data verification"}]}

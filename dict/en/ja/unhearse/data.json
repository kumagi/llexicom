It is unlikely to be encountered in everyday language. Understanding its meaning requires familiarity with older texts and a strong vocabulary. The prefix 'un-' indicates a reversal of the action associated with 'hearse,' which is a vehicle used to carry a coffin. Therefore, 'unhearse' means to remove something from a hearse, or more broadly, to disinter a body."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The coffin was carefully unhearsed before the funeral service began.","translation":"葬儀が始まる前に、棺は慎重に霊柩車から降ろされた。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"霊柩車から降ろす"},{"sentence":"In a dramatic scene, the body was unhearsed from its grave.","translation":"劇的な場面で、遺体は墓から掘り起こされた。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"埋葬を掘り起こす"}]}

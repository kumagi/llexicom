It refers to the interaction between plants, sap-feeding insects (like aphids), and other insects (like ants) that feed on the sugary honeydew excreted by the sap-feeders. The ants often protect the sap-feeders from predators, creating a mutually beneficial relationship. This term is typically encountered in advanced ecological studies or research papers.

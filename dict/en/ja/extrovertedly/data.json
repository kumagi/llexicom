This means they are outgoing, sociable, and enjoy being around other people. It's a more advanced word, so you'll likely encounter it in more complex texts or discussions about personality traits. It's formed by adding '-ly' to the adjective 'extroverted'. Remember to use it to modify verbs, describing *how* someone does something, rather than describing the person directly (which would use the adjective 'extroverted')."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The salesperson extrovertedly greeted each customer who entered the store.","translation":"その販売員は店に入ってくる客一人一人に外向的に挨拶をした。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"in an outgoing manner"},{"sentence":"He extrovertedly shared his travel experiences with the group.","translation":"彼は自分の旅行経験をグループに積極的に共有した。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"in a sociable manner"},{"sentence":"She extrovertedly took the stage and began her performance.","translation":"彼女は積極的にステージに上がり、パフォーマンスを始めた。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"in a confident manner"}]}

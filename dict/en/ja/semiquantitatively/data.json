'Quantitatively' comes from 'quantitative', which relates to quantity or measurement.

For example, you might analyze a chemical reaction 'semiquantitatively' to get a rough estimate of how much of a substance is present, without doing a full, detailed measurement."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The samples were screened semiquantitatively to identify those with elevated levels of the target analyte.","translation":"サンプルは、標的分析物のレベルが上昇しているものを特定するために、半定量的にスクリーニングされた。","type":"general"},{"sentence":"The results were interpreted semiquantitatively by comparing the band intensities on the gel.","translation":"結果は、ゲルのバンド強度を比較することによって半定量的に解釈された。","type":"scientific"},{"sentence":"The environmental impact was assessed semiquantitatively using a scoring system based on expert judgment.","translation":"環境への影響は、専門家の判断に基づくスコアリングシステムを用いて半定量的に評価された。","type":"environmental"}]}

A non-aspirated consonant is one that is pronounced without this puff of air. The distinction between aspirated and non-aspirated consonants is phonemic (meaning it can change the meaning of a word) in some languages, such as Hindi and Thai, but not in others, such as English (where it's allophonic, meaning it's a predictable variation of a sound that doesn't change the meaning of a word).","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The 'p' in 'pot' is non-aspirated.","correct":"✓ The 'p' in 'spot' is non-aspirated.","note":"In English, initial voiceless stops like /p/, /t/, and /k/ are typically aspirated, unless they are preceded by /s/ (as in 'spot', 'stop', 'skate')."},{"incorrect":"✗ Aspiration is not important for non-aspirated consonants.","correct":"✓ Aspiration is the absence of a puff of air for non-aspirated consonants.","note":"Aspiration is relevant in the *absence* for non-aspirated consonants.

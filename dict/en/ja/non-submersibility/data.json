It's used in contexts where the ability to stay above water is critical, such as in the design and safety features of ships and submarines. The word is formed by adding 'non-' to 'submersibility', which itself is derived from 'submersible', meaning capable of being submerged. Understanding this term requires a grasp of technical vocabulary related to buoyancy and naval engineering."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The design of the lifeboat emphasized non-submersibility to ensure passenger safety.","translation":"救命ボートの設計は、乗客の安全を確保するために不沈性を重視していた。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"不沈性"},{"sentence":"The new coating significantly enhances the non-submersibility of the underwater drone.","translation":"新しいコーティングは、水中ドローンの不沈性を大幅に向上させる。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"不沈性"}]}

It describes a condition or state of reduced power or effectiveness. It is formed by combining the prefix 'sub-' (meaning 'less than' or 'below') with 'potency' (meaning 'power' or 'effectiveness'). Therefore, 'subpotency' indicates a level of power or effectiveness that is less than the normal or expected amount. Understanding the meanings of the prefix 'sub-' and the root word 'potency' is helpful in deciphering the meaning of 'subpotency'."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The doctor suspected hormonal subpotency as a possible cause of the patient's symptoms.","translation":"医師は、患者の症状の考えられる原因として、ホルモン性の潜在能力の低下を疑った。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"medical"},{"sentence":"The subpotency of the government's response to the crisis was widely criticized.","translation":"政府の危機対応の潜在的な力の弱さは広く批判された。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"general"}]}

It describes the degree to which a claim or theory can be proven wrong through evidence. A highly refragable theory is one that makes specific predictions that, if shown to be false, would disprove the theory. This concept is central to the idea that scientific theories should be testable and open to revision based on new evidence. The more opportunities a theory has to be disproven, the stronger it becomes if it withstands those tests. This term is rarely used outside of academic discussions of scientific methodology."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The scientist emphasized the importance of refragability in formulating a testable hypothesis.","translation":"科学者は、検証可能な仮説を立てる上で反駁可能性の重要性を強調した。","type":"general","meaning_category":"General usage"},{"sentence":"The lack of refragability in the politician's claims made them difficult to evaluate objectively.","translation":"政治家の主張には反駁可能性が欠けていたため、客観的に評価することが困難だった。","type":"critical","meaning_category":"Critical analysis"},{"sentence":"The refragability of the model was assessed by comparing its predictions to empirical data.","translation":"モデルの反駁可能性は、その予測を実証データと比較することによって評価された。","type":"scientific","meaning_category":"Scientific context"}]}

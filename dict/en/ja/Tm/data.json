It's a symbol used to indicate that a brand name or logo is legally registered as a trademark with the relevant intellectual property office. Companies use TM to protect their branding and prevent others from using similar marks that could cause confusion in the marketplace.  It signifies ownership and legal rights associated with the brand. While often seen alongside the ® (Registered Trademark) symbol, **TM** indicates an *intention* to claim a trademark, even before formal registration is complete. It's common in advertising, packaging, and product documentation."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"Apple® and iPhone® are registered trademarks of Apple Inc.","translation":"アップル®とiPhone®は、アップル社の登録商標です。","type":"Noun/Symbol - Trademark","meaning_category":"Trademark symbol"},{"sentence":"The company uses the **TM** symbol next to its logo.","translation":"その会社はロゴの横に™マークを使用しています。","type":"Noun/Symbol - Trademark","meaning_category":"Trademark indication"},{"sentence":"The product packaging clearly displays the **TM** symbol to protect its brand identity.","translation":"製品のパッケージには、ブランドアイデンティティを保護するために™マークが明確に表示されています。","type":"Noun/Symbol - Trademark","meaning_category":"Brand protection"},{"sentence":"Before registering the trademark, they used the **TM** symbol to show their claim.","translation":"商標登録前に、™マークを使用して権利を主張しました。","type":"Noun/Symbol - Trademark","meaning_category":"Intention to trademark"}]}

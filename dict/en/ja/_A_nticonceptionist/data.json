It is formed by combining 'anti-' (against), 'conception' (the process of becoming pregnant), and '-ist' (a person who follows a particular belief). This word is not commonly used in everyday conversation and is more likely to appear in discussions about reproductive rights, ethics, or religious beliefs.

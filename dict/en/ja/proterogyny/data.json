This can occur in both animals and plants. In animals, it often involves sex change. In plants, it is a mechanism to promote cross-pollination by ensuring that the pistils are receptive before the plant's own pollen is released.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Proterogyny is when the male parts mature first.","correct":"✓ Proterogyny is when the female parts mature first.","note":"Proterogyny specifically refers to female parts maturing before male parts.

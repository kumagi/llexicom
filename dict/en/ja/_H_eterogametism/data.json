For example, in humans, males have XY chromosomes while females have XX chromosomes, making males heterogametic. This term is most often encountered in advanced biology or genetics courses. It's important to remember that which sex is heterogametic varies across species (e.g., birds have ZW females and ZZ males)."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The study of heterogametism in various species has provided insights into the evolution of sex determination mechanisms.","translation":"様々な種における異型配偶子性の研究は、性決定メカニズムの進化に関する洞察を提供してきた。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"性決定メカニズム"},{"sentence":"In the XY system of sex determination, the male exhibits heterogametism.","translation":"XY性決定システムでは、雄が異型配偶子性を示す。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"性決定システム"}]}

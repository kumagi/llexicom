It is not a commonly used term and may be more frequently found in written rather than spoken English. The word is formed by combining \"soon\" and \"consoled,\" connected by a hyphen to function as a single adjective. Understanding the individual components of the word helps in grasping its meaning: \"soon\" implies quickly or shortly, and \"consoled\" means having received comfort or alleviation of distress. Thus, \"soon-consoled\" describes someone who recovers quickly from emotional upset due to their ability to be easily comforted."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The baby was soon-consoled with a gentle lullaby.","translation":"その赤ちゃんは優しい子守唄ですぐに慰められた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"easily comforted"},{"sentence":"He was a soon-consoled individual, always finding the silver lining in every cloud.","translation":"彼はすぐに慰められる人で、いつもどんな困難にも良い面を見つけていた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"easily cheered up"},{"sentence":"Unlike her sister, she was soon-consoled after losing the game.","translation":"妹とは違って、彼女は試合に負けた後すぐに慰められた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"readily solaced"}]}

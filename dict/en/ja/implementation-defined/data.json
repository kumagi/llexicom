It indicates that while the standard doesn't mandate a specific behavior, each implementation (compiler, interpreter, etc.) *must* define and document how it handles a particular situation.

It means that the way a particular piece of code behaves is not strictly defined by the standard language specification.

This is different from \"undefined behavior,\" where the compiler can do absolutely anything, including crashing or producing incorrect results, without any obligation to document it.

It's not a common word, and you'll mostly find it in medical reports or textbooks. If you're not in a medical field, you probably won't encounter this word often. The prefix 'intra-' means 'within,' and 'valvular' refers to a valve. So, 'intravalvular' simply means 'within the valve.'"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"Echocardiography revealed an intravalvular mass consistent with a vegetation.","translation":"心エコー検査で、疣贅に一致する弁内腫瘤が明らかになった。","type":"medical imaging report","meaning_category":"location of a mass"},{"sentence":"The surgeon carefully removed the intravalvular calcifications during the valve repair.","translation":"外科医は弁修復中に弁内の石灰化を注意深く除去した。","type":"surgical procedure","meaning_category":"surgical removal of calcifications"}]}

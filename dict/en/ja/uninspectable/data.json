It is formed by adding 'un-' to 'inspectable', which means able to be inspected. This word is not very common and is often used in technical or formal contexts. For example, a part of a machine might be uninspectable if it is sealed or hidden, or a section of computer code might be uninspectable if it is encrypted or protected.

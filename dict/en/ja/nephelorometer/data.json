The more particles present, the more light is scattered. This is different from a transmissometer, which measures the amount of light that passes *through* the sample.

It works by shining a light through the sample and measuring how much light is scattered by the particles in the sample. The more particles, the more scattering, and the higher the reading on the nephelorometer. This is useful in many fields, such as environmental science, where it can be used to monitor water quality.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The laboratory technician used a **nephelorometer** to determine the concentration of bacteria in the sample.","translation":"実験技師は比濁計を使ってサンプル中のバクテリア濃度を測定した。","type":"general","meaning_category":"measurement"},{"sentence":"Air quality was assessed using a **nephelorometer** to measure particulate matter.","translation":"大気質は、粒子状物質を測定するために比濁計を使って評価された。","type":"environmental","meaning_category":"environment"}]}

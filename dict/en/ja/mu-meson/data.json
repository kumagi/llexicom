It refers to what is now known as a 'muon', a type of lepton. This term is rarely used in contemporary scientific literature or discussions. It's primarily encountered in historical contexts when discussing the early development of particle physics. Understanding that 'mu-meson' is equivalent to 'muon' is important for interpreting older texts, but the modern term 'muon' should be used in current writing and speech."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"Early experiments identified what they called a 'mu-meson'.","translation":"初期の実験では、彼らが「ミュー中間子」と呼ぶものを特定した。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"粒子物理学"},{"sentence":"The properties of the 'mu-meson' were initially confusing to physicists.","translation":"「ミュー中間子」の特性は、当初物理学者を混乱させた。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"粒子物理学"}]}

It refers to something that is measured or calculated with respect to the stars, using sidereal time. Sidereal time is a time scale based on the Earth's rotation relative to the fixed stars, not the Sun. Therefore, \"sidereally\" is used to describe motions, positions, or periods that are determined by observing the stars. This word is not commonly used in everyday conversation and is more likely to be found in scientific or technical contexts related to astronomy."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The telescope tracks the stars sidereally.","translation":"望遠鏡は恒星時で星を追跡する。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"恒星時で"},{"sentence":"The planet's rotation was measured sidereally.","translation":"その惑星の自転は恒星時で測定された。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"恒星を基準として"}]}

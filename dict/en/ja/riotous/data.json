It can apply to people, events, or even the appearance of nature (e.g., a garden with a profusion of colors). The word often carries a negative connotation when describing human behavior, suggesting a lack of order or control. However, when describing nature, it can have a more positive connotation, suggesting abundance and vibrancy.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"The garden was riotous with calm colors.","correct":"The garden was riotous with vibrant colors.","note":"'Riotous' implies a wild, unrestrained display, so it's usually paired with words like 'vibrant,' 'bright,' or 'bold' rather than 'calm' or 'subdued'."},{"incorrect":"The library was riotous.","correct":"The library was noisy.","note":"'Riotous' suggests a level of disorder and uncontrolled behavior that is unlikely to occur in a library.

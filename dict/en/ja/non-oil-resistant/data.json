It is often used in technical contexts, such as engineering, manufacturing, and automotive industries, to indicate that a particular component is unsuitable for use in environments where it will come into contact with oil or petroleum-based products. It is important to note that the absence of oil resistance can lead to degradation, swelling, or failure of the material.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ This material is not oil resistant, it's non oil resistant.","correct":"✓ This material is not oil-resistant; it's non-oil-resistant.","note":"The correct form is 'non-oil-resistant' with hyphens to connect all the words into a single adjective.

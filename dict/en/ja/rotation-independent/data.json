It describes a property or method that remains unaffected by changes in the rotational orientation of an object or system. This is particularly important when dealing with data or systems where the orientation may vary, but the underlying characteristics need to be consistently recognized or measured.","priority":"☆☆☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The system is rotation independent.","correct":"✓ The system is rotation-independent.","note":"The hyphen is important for clarity, especially in technical writing.

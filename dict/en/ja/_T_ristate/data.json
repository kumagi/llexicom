This is different from standard binary logic, which only has two states (0 and 1). The third state is a high-impedance state, which effectively disconnects the output from the circuit, allowing other devices to use the same line. Tristate logic is commonly used in situations where multiple devices need to share a single communication line or bus.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The tristate is always on.","correct":"✓ The tristate is enabled.","note":"Tristate devices are not \"on\" or \"off\" in the traditional sense.

It describes a type of circuit or device that can exist in one of three states: a high state (representing a logical 1), a low state (representing a logical 0), and a high-impedance state (representing a disconnected or inactive state). Understanding this term requires some familiarity with basic electronics and digital logic concepts. It's commonly used in contexts involving memory systems, data buses, and multiplexing.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"A **tristate** buffer is used to isolate the memory from the data bus.","translation":"トライステートバッファは、メモリをデータバスから分離するために使用される。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"Electrical Engineering"},{"sentence":"The **tristate** output allows multiple devices to share the same data line.","translation":"トライステート出力により、複数のデバイスが同じデータ線を共有できる。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"Electrical Engineering"},{"sentence":"The **tristate** gate is enabled when the control signal is high.","translation":"トライステートゲートは、制御信号がハイのときに有効になる。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"Electrical Engineering"}]}

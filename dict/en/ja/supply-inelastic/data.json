This often happens when it's difficult or takes a long time to produce more of something. For example, if there's a limited amount of a rare mineral, increasing the price won't necessarily lead to a significant increase in the amount available because there's only so much to be found. This is the opposite of 'supply-elastic', where businesses can easily increase or decrease production in response to price changes."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"Because of the limited land available, urban housing is often **supply-inelastic**.","translation":"利用可能な土地が限られているため、都市部の住宅はしばしば供給非弾力的である。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"limited supply"},{"sentence":"The **supply-inelastic** nature of oil production can lead to dramatic price swings during periods of high demand.","translation":"石油生産の供給非弾力的な性質は、需要が高い時期に劇的な価格変動を引き起こす可能性がある。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"unresponsive to price changes"}]}

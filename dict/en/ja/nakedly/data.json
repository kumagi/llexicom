'Naked' comes from the Old English word 'nacod', meaning 'bare, unclothed'. The adverbial form 'nakedly' thus describes something done in a bare, open, or unconcealed manner.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/ˈneɪkɪdli/","syllables":"na-ked-ly"},"inflection":{"notes":"As an adverb, 'nakedly' does not have different inflections."},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Nakedly' is used to describe actions or states that are presented in a very direct and unconcealed way. It can also describe a physical state of being unclothed or exposed. The word often carries a connotation of vulnerability or lack of pretense.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ She nakedly felt sad.","correct":"✓ She felt nakedly sad. / ✓ She felt naked and sad.","note":"'Nakedly' should modify the verb, not the adjective. If you want to describe the feeling itself as bare or exposed, use 'nakedly' to modify the verb 'felt'. Alternatively, you can use 'naked' as an adjective alongside 'sad'."},{"incorrect":"✗ He nakedly told the secret to everyone.","correct":"✓ He openly told the secret to everyone. / ✓ He nakedly confessed the secret to everyone.","note":"While 'nakedly' can mean openly, it often implies a degree of vulnerability or directness that might not be appropriate for simply conveying information. 'Openly' is a more general term. 'Nakedly confessed' is more fitting if the confession was particularly raw or unreserved."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["naked (adjective)","nakedness (noun)"],"phrases":["naked truth (むき出しの真実)","stand nakedly (むき出しに立つ)"],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"The word 'nakedly' describes something done in a very open and unconcealed way, often implying a lack of pretense or vulnerability.

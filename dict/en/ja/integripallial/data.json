It refers to the condition where the pallial sinus (an indentation in the pallial line, which marks the attachment of the mantle to the shell) is either absent or very short, effectively making the pallial line 'complete' or 'uninterrupted'. This is in contrast to sinupalliate bivalves, which have a more developed pallial sinus.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{},"related_words":{"derivatives":["pallial","pallium","sinupalliate"],"related_terms":[]},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"N/A","frequency_google_ngram":"Very low frequency - specialized zoological term.","priority":"☆☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C2","text":"'Integripallial' is a highly specialized term used in the field of zoology, particularly when describing the shells of bivalve mollusks (like clams and mussels). It describes a specific anatomical feature: the nature of the pallial line inside the shell. If a bivalve is 'integripallial,' it means that the pallial line (a scar marking where the mantle, the fleshy tissue that lines the shell, attaches) is unbroken or only slightly indented. This is an advanced concept, primarily encountered in scientific literature or detailed zoological studies."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"Integripallial bivalves are often associated with a burrowing lifestyle where deep retraction into the shell is not required.","translation":"完全外套膜の二枚貝は、殻の中に深く引っ込む必要のない、穴を掘る生活様式に関連付けられることが多い。","type":"technical","meaning_category":"zoology"}]}

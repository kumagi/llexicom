When heated or cooled, these materials generate a temporary voltage. This is because temperature changes modify the positions of the atoms slightly within the crystal structure, such that the polarization of the material changes. This effect is used in various applications, such as infrared sensors and energy harvesting. The term itself is derived from the Greek words for fire and electricity, reflecting the link between temperature change and electrical potential generation."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The pyroelectricity of the crystal allowed it to detect minute changes in temperature.","translation":"その結晶の焦電性により、微細な温度変化を検出することができました。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"焦電性"},{"sentence":"Researchers are exploring new pyroelectric materials for energy harvesting applications.","translation":"研究者たちは、エネルギーハーベスティング応用に向けて、新しい焦電性材料を研究しています。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"焦電性材料"}]}

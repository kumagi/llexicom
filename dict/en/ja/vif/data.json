Multicollinearity occurs when two or more predictor variables in a multiple regression model are highly correlated, meaning that one can be predicted from the others. High VIF values indicate that the standard errors of the regression coefficients are inflated, making it difficult to assess the individual impact of each predictor variable on the dependent variable. A common rule of thumb is that VIF values greater than 5 or 10 suggest problematic multicollinearity.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"The VIF is low, so there is multicollinearity.","correct":"The VIF is low, so there is little or no multicollinearity.","note":"Low VIF values indicate the absence of significant multicollinearity."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":[],"related_terms":["multicollinearity","regression analysis","predictor variable","independent variable","tolerance"],"priority":"★★★"},"level_frequency":{"level":"Advanced (Statistics)","frequency_google_ngram":"Low (Specialized statistical term)","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"Advanced","text":"VIF (Variance Inflation Factor) is a statistical term used in regression analysis to measure how much the variance of an estimated regression coefficient increases if your predictors are correlated.

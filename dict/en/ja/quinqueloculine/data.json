It refers to a specific arrangement of chambers in the shell, where each chamber is added at approximately 144-degree angles to the previous one, resulting in a five-chambered pattern visible from the exterior. This term is unlikely to be encountered outside of scientific literature or discussions related to foraminifera. Understanding this term requires familiarity with the morphology and classification of foraminifera."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The sediment sample contained numerous quinqueloculine foraminifera.","translation":"その堆積物のサンプルには、多数の五室型の有孔虫が含まれていた。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"five-chambered (foraminiferal shell)"}]}

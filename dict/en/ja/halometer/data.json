Halos are optical phenomena that appear as rings or arcs of light around the sun or moon, caused by ice crystals in the atmosphere. A halometer is designed to precisely measure the angles of these halos, providing data that can be used to study atmospheric conditions and ice crystal properties. This term is typically encountered in scientific or meteorological contexts.","priority":"★★☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The researcher used a halometer to accurately measure the 22° halo.","translation":"研究者はハロメーターを使用して、22°ハロを正確に測定しました。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"instrument"},{"sentence":"Halometers are essential tools for studying atmospheric optics.","translation":"ハロメーターは、大気光学を研究するための不可欠なツールです。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"instrument"}]}

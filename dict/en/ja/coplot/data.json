The key feature of a coplot is that it shows how the relationship between the response and one predictor changes as the values of the other predictor(s) vary. The other predictor(s) are called conditioning variables.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ I made a coplot, but I don't understand what it means.","correct":"✓ I created a coplot, but I don't understand how to interpret it.","note":"It's more common to say \"interpret a coplot\" rather than \"understand what it means\"."},{"incorrect":"✗ The coplot is a type of chart.","correct":"✓ The coplot is a type of plot.","note":"Use the word \"plot\" instead of \"chart\"."}],"priority":"★☆☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["conditioning variable","scatterplot","visualization","statistical graphics"],"phrasal_verbs":[],"priority":"★☆☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"The term \"coplot\" refers to a specific type of statistical plot used to visualize relationships between variables, especially when one variable's relationship with another is influenced by a third variable.

This concept is particularly important in fields like quantum physics (where the no-cloning theorem applies), cryptography, and security, where ensuring that information or objects cannot be perfectly duplicated is crucial. It is often used in the context of quantum key distribution, physical unclonable functions (PUFs), and anti-counterfeiting technologies.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The unclonability is ensure by the system.","correct":"✓ The unclonability is ensured by the system.","note":"Ensure is a verb, so it needs to be conjugated correctly (ensured)."},{"incorrect":"✗ Unclonability is more good than clonability.","correct":"✓ Unclonability is better than clonability.","note":"Use 'better' as the comparative form of 'good'."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["unclonable (adjective)"],"related_concepts":["quantum key distribution (QKD)","physical unclonable function (PUF)","no-cloning theorem","anti-counterfeiting","cryptography"],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency - technical term used in specific fields.","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"\"Unclonability\" is a technical term that means something cannot be perfectly copied or cloned.

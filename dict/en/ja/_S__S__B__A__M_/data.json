It is more efficient than traditional AM because it suppresses one sideband and the carrier signal, which reduces the bandwidth and power required for transmission. This makes it useful for long-distance communication and applications where bandwidth is limited. It is often simply referred to as SSB (Single-SideBand).","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ I used AM instead of SSBAM because it's more efficient.","correct":"✓ I used SSBAM instead of AM because it's more efficient.","note":"SSBAM is more efficient than AM due to the suppression of the carrier and one sideband."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["SSB","Amplitude Modulation","Modulation","Demodulation"],"phrasal_verbs":[],"priority":"★★★"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"SSBAM (Single-SideBand Amplitude Modulation) is a technical term used in radio communications.

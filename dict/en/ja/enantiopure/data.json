It can be used as a noun to refer to an enantiopure substance, but this is less common."},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Enantiopure' is a term used in chemistry, particularly in organic chemistry and pharmacology, to describe a substance that consists of only one enantiomer. Enantiomers are stereoisomers that are mirror images of each other but are non-superimposable, much like left and right hands. The presence of even small amounts of the other enantiomer can significantly affect the properties and biological activity of a compound. Therefore, obtaining enantiopure compounds is crucial in many applications, especially in the pharmaceutical industry, where different enantiomers of a drug can have different effects on the body.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The reaction resulted in a racemic mixture, but we tried to make it enantiopure.","correct":"✓ The reaction resulted in a racemic mixture, but we tried to make it enantiopure.","note":"The correct spelling is 'enantiopure', not 'enantropure' or other variations."},{"incorrect":"✗ Enantiopure is when a mixture has equal amounts of both enantiomers.","correct":"✓ Enantiopure is when a substance contains only one enantiomer.","note":"Enantiopure means that only one enantiomer is present.

Imagine your left and right hands: they are mirror images but cannot be perfectly superimposed on each other. Similarly, molecules can exist in two forms that are mirror images. When a substance is 'enantiopure,' it means that it contains only one of those forms, with none of the other form present. This is important in fields like drug development, because the two enantiomers of a drug can have very different effects on the body.","priority":"★☆☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The new catalyst allows for the synthesis of highly enantiopure products.","translation":"その新しい触媒は、高度に光学異性体純粋な生成物の合成を可能にする。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"chemical purity"},{"sentence":"The separation technique yielded the desired enantiopure compound.","translation":"その分離技術は、望ましい光学異性体純粋な化合物を生み出した。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"chemical purity"},{"sentence":"The pharmaceutical company requires all drugs to be in enantiopure form.","translation":"その製薬会社は、すべての薬が光学異性体純粋な形であることを要求している。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"pharmaceuticals"}]}

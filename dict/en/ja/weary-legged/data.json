It's used to describe someone whose legs are tired, usually after a long period of physical activity like walking or running. Because it's a more descriptive and less common word, it's typically found in more advanced texts or literature where the author wants to create a vivid image of physical exhaustion. The word is fairly straightforward in meaning, but its usage is more nuanced and less frequent than simpler alternatives like 'tired'.

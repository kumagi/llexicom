The position of each dot on the horizontal and vertical axis indicates the values for an individual data point. Scattergraphs are primarily used to observe and visually display the relationship or correlation between these two variables. Patterns in the scattergraph can suggest different types of correlation, such as positive (as one variable increases, the other tends to increase), negative (as one variable increases, the other tends to decrease), or no correlation (the points appear randomly scattered).","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The scattergraph shows the average of the data.","correct":"✓ The scattergraph shows the correlation between two variables.","note":"Scattergraphs are used to show the relationship between two variables, not to display averages.

Imagine you have data about people's heights and weights. You can put this data on a scattergraph, where each dot represents one person, and its position shows their height and weight. By looking at the pattern of the dots, you can see if there's a connection between height and weight – for example, whether taller people tend to weigh more. Scattergraphs are useful for spotting trends and correlations in data. They are often used in science, statistics, and data analysis."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The analyst created a scattergraph to identify potential outliers in the dataset.","translation":"アナリストは、データセット内の潜在的な外れ値を特定するために散布図を作成した。","type":"general usage","meaning_category":"data analysis"},{"sentence":"By examining the scattergraph, we could see a clear trend of increasing sales with higher advertising spending.","translation":"散布図を調べることで、広告費の増加に伴い売上が増加するという明確な傾向が見られた。","type":"business","meaning_category":"business analysis"},{"sentence":"The scattergraph indicated no significant correlation between study time and exam scores.","translation":"散布図は、学習時間と試験のスコアの間に有意な相関関係がないことを示していた。","type":"education","meaning_category":"educational research"}]}

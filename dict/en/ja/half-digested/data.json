This can apply literally to food in the digestive system or metaphorically to information or ideas that have not been fully understood or assimilated. When used literally, it describes the state of food that has begun to be broken down by the digestive process but is not yet fully absorbed. Metaphorically, it describes information or ideas that someone has encountered but has not fully processed or understood, often resulting in a superficial or incomplete understanding.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ He had a half digested dream.","correct":"✓ He had a vague dream.","note":"While 'half-digested' can be used metaphorically, it's usually applied to information or theories rather than dreams.

It involves determining the concentration of a substance by reacting it with a known amount of another substance. While 'titteration' is a valid term, 'titration' is much more commonly used and understood. Therefore, it's best to use 'titration' unless you have a specific reason to use the less common variant."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The chemist performed a precise titteration to analyze the sample.","translation":"化学者はサンプルを分析するために正確な滴定を行った。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"滴定"},{"sentence":"The endpoint of the titteration was clearly visible.","translation":"滴定の終点は明確に見えた。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"滴定"}]}

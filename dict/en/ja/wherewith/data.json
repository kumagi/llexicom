It functions as both an adverb, meaning 'with which' or 'by which', and a noun, denoting 'the means or resources', particularly financial. Due to its obsolescence, it's primarily found in older texts or when intentionally employing antiquated language. Modern equivalents such as 'with what', 'by what means', or simply 'resources' are generally preferred.

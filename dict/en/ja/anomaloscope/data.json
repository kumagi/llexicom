It works by presenting the observer with a split field of light. One half of the field is a pure yellow light of a fixed intensity. The other half is a mixture of red and green lights, and the observer adjusts the proportions of red and green until the mixed light matches the pure yellow light in both hue and brightness. The settings chosen by the observer are then compared to the settings expected from someone with normal color vision. Significant deviations from the norm indicate a color vision deficiency, and the specific pattern of deviations can help to classify the type and severity of the deficiency.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ I used a spectroscope to test for color blindness.","correct":"✓ I used an anomaloscope to test for color blindness.","note":"A spectroscope is used to analyze the spectrum of light, while an anomaloscope is specifically designed for color vision testing."},{"incorrect":"✗ The anomaloscope can cure color blindness.","correct":"✓ The anomaloscope can diagnose color blindness.","note":"An anomaloscope is a diagnostic tool, not a treatment for color blindness."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["anomalous (adjective: abnormal, irregular)","anomaly (noun: abnormality, irregularity)"],"phrasal_verbs":[],"related_medical_terms":["color blindness","color vision deficiency","protanopia","deuteranopia","tritanopia"],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"The term 'anomaloscope' refers to a highly specialized instrument used in the field of ophthalmology for the precise diagnosis of color vision deficiencies, particularly those involving red and green perception. Understanding its function requires familiarity with concepts of color vision, light mixing, and diagnostic procedures in eye care. The word itself is derived from Greek roots, reflecting its purpose as an instrument ('scope') for observing visual anomalies ('anomalo-'). Due to its technical nature and limited application outside of specialized medical contexts, it is not a commonly encountered term.","priority":"★☆☆"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The anomaloscope is a key tool in the diagnosis of protanopia and deuteranopia.","translation":"異常色覚鏡は、第一色盲と第二色盲の診断における重要な道具である。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"色盲検査器"},{"sentence":"Using the anomaloscope, the researcher was able to quantify the subject's color matching range.","translation":"研究者は異常色覚鏡を使って、被験者の色のマッチング範囲を定量化することができた。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"色盲検査器"}]}

It describes the process where a consonant sound changes into a fricative sound. A fricative is a consonant made by forcing air through a narrow channel in the mouth, like the 'f' or 's' sound. So, if a 't' sound changes to an 's' sound, that's an example of spirantizing. This term is mainly used by people who study language and phonetics.","priority":"★★★"},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The linguist observed the spirantizing of /t/ to /θ/ in the local dialect.","translation":"言語学者は、地元の方言における/t/から/θ/への摩擦音化を観察した。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"linguistics"},{"sentence":"In some languages, intervocalic stops are prone to spirantizing.","translation":"いくつかの言語では、母音間の閉鎖音は摩擦音化しやすい。","type":"verb","meaning_category":"linguistics"}]}

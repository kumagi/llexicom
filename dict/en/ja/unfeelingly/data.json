It's used to describe actions or words that are insensitive or cruel. Because it describes a lack of emotion and is often used in critical contexts, it's more common in advanced vocabulary. It is formed from the adjective 'unfeeling' by adding the suffix '-ly', which turns adjectives into adverbs. The root word 'feel' is a common word, but the addition of 'un-' and '-ing' makes 'unfeelingly' a more complex and less frequent term."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The politician unfeelingly dismissed the concerns of the unemployed workers.","translation":"その政治家は失業中の労働者たちの懸念を思いやりなく退けた。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"無情に"},{"sentence":"She spoke unfeelingly about the tragedy, as if it were just another news story.","translation":"彼女はその悲劇について、まるでただのニュース記事であるかのように、無情に話した。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"冷酷に"},{"sentence":"He unfeelingly ignored her pleas for help.","translation":"彼は彼女の助けを求める懇願を思いやりなく無視した。","type":"adverb","meaning_category":"思いやりなく"}]}

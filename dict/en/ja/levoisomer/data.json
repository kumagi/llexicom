The term 'levo' comes from the Latin word for 'left', indicating that the rotation is counterclockwise. They are often denoted with an 'L-' prefix or a '(-)' sign. Understanding levoisomers is crucial in fields like chemistry, pharmacology, and biochemistry because different isomers can have vastly different biological effects.","priority":"★★★"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ The levoisomer is the same as the dextroisomer.","correct":"✓ The levoisomer is different from the dextroisomer.","note":"Levoisomers and dextroisomers are distinct stereoisomers with opposite optical activities."},{"incorrect":"✗ Levoisomer is only found in inorganic compounds.","correct":"✓ Levoisomer is found in organic compounds.","note":"Levoisomers are primarily associated with organic compounds, especially those with chiral centers."}],"priority":"★★☆"},"related_words":{"derivatives":["levorotation","levorotatory"],"phrasal_verbs":[],"priority":"★★☆"},"level_frequency":{"CEFR":"C2","frequency_google_ngram":"Low frequency - specialized scientific term.","priority":"★☆☆"},"readability_explanation":{"level":"C1","text":"The term 'levoisomer' refers to a specific type of molecule in chemistry.

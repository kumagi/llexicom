It refers to the absence of dispersion, which is the phenomenon where different components of a wave (e.g., different colors of light) travel at different speeds within a medium, leading to their separation.

It describes a situation where different parts of a wave (like different colors of light) do not separate as they travel through a material. This is important in technologies like fiber optics, where you want to send signals without distortion. The word is formed by adding \"non-\" to \"dispersion\", which means the opposite of spreading out. It's not a common word in everyday conversation, but it's important in specific scientific contexts."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The new fiber optic cable boasts near-perfect nondispersion, allowing for faster data transmission.","translation":"その新しい光ファイバーケーブルは、ほぼ完璧な非分散性を誇り、より高速なデータ伝送を可能にする。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"property"},{"sentence":"The engineer sought a nondispersion material for the lens to improve image clarity.","translation":"エンジニアは、画像の鮮明度を向上させるために、レンズ用の非分散材料を探した。","type":"adjective","meaning_category":"property"}]}

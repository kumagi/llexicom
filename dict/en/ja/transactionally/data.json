'Transaction' originates from the Latin 'transigere,' meaning 'to drive through, accomplish, settle,' which is a combination of 'trans-' (across) and 'agere' (to do, drive). The suffix '-ly' turns the adjective 'transactional' into an adverb.","priority":"★★☆"},"pronunciation":{"ipa":"/trænˈzækʃənəli/","syllables":"tran-zac-tion-al-ly"},"inflection":{"notes":"This is an adverb, so it does not have different forms like nouns or verbs."},"usage_notes":{"explanation":"'Transactionally' describes actions or processes that are conducted with a primary focus on the exchange or interaction itself, often emphasizing efficiency, immediate outcomes, and individual deals rather than long-term relationships or broader contexts.

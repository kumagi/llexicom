It involves titration, where a known concentration of acid (standard solution) is gradually added to the alkaline solution until the reaction is complete, typically indicated by a color change of an indicator. This method is crucial in various fields, including environmental monitoring, pharmaceutical analysis, and food chemistry.","priority":"★★☆"},"common_mistakes":{"examples":[{"incorrect":"✗ Alkalimetry is the process of measuring acidity.","correct":"✓ Alkalimetry is the process of measuring alkalinity.","note":"Alkalimetry measures alkalinity, not acidity.

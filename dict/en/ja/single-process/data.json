It describes a system or application that operates within a single process space, meaning all operations and tasks are executed within the same memory space and process. Understanding this term requires familiarity with basic concepts of operating systems and process management. It's often contrasted with 'multi-process' architectures, where applications are divided into multiple processes that can run concurrently or in parallel.

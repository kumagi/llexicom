This can mean their names are removed from records, their achievements are ignored, and they are essentially erased from history. The word comes from the book '1984,' where the government did this to people who disagreed with them. It's a strong term that suggests a deliberate attempt to deny someone's importance or even their existence. Sometimes, it's also used more generally to describe people who are ignored or treated as unimportant, even if they haven't been officially erased."},"example_sentences":[{"sentence":"The dictator turned anyone who opposed him into **nonpersons**.","translation":"独裁者は彼に反対する者を誰でもノンパーソンに変えた。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"抹消された人々"},{"sentence":"She felt like a **nonperson** at the large conference, unable to make connections.","translation":"彼女は大規模な会議で、誰とも繋がることができず、取るに足らない存在のように感じた。","type":"noun","meaning_category":"重要でない人々"}]}

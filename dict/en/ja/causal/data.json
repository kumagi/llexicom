It is often used in scientific, academic, and technical contexts to discuss the relationship between cause and effect. It is important to distinguish between correlation and causation.

It's important to understand that 'causal' implies a direct relationship where one thing leads to another, unlike 'correlation' which simply means two things are related without necessarily having a cause-and-effect relationship. You will often see 'causal' used in phrases like 'causal relationship' or 'causal factor'.
